SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: Spiderpool: Dynamic Topology-Aware RDMA Allocation For GPU-Based AI Workloads - Weizhou Lan\, Technical Lead
DESCRIPTION:With the rise of small AI models and the increasing computational power of GPUs\, a new requirement is emerging in AI distributed inference workloads: a single AI container does not need all 8 GPUs on a node\, but data parallelism still relies on RDMA networks for distributed communication. In such cases\, only a matching number of PCIe-affined RDMA NICs is needed to enable GPUDirect RDMA.\nHowever\, the GPU device plugin\, RDMA device plugin\, and CNI operate independently. This prevents administrators from configuring workload YAMLs to ensure that PCIe-affined RDMA NICs are correctly assigned. Consequently\, in practice\, Pods often have to be attached to all network interfaces and RDMA devices.\nRecently\, based on DRA and NRI\, Spiderpool can dynamically detect the assigned GPU devices at Pod creation time and allocate PCIe-affined RDMA NICs and Ethernet interfaces accordingly. This approach minimizes network resource overhead while ensuring optimal RDMA communication performance.

SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: 5 Key Lessons From 8 Years of Building Kgateway - Yuval Kohavi\, Lead Maintainer
DESCRIPTION:At first glance\, all Envoy-based gateways that implement the Kubernetes Gateway API may appear similar. In practice\, the key differences lie in their control plane architecture\, API extensions\, and implementation choices.\n\nIn this lightning talk\, we’ll share five critical lessons we've learned over the past eight years while building and evolving kgateway (formerly known as Gloo). From scaling challenges to user experience improvements\, we’ll explorewhat worked\, what didn’t\, and what we might do differently—like whether we should have donated to the CNCF earlier or avoided using the Istio control plane altogether.\n\nJoin us to explore the real-world insights behind kgateway’s journey.

SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: Linkerd\, mTLS\, and Bungled Bundles - Phil Henderson\, Contributor
DESCRIPTION:Like every other mTLS-based system out there (mesh or otherwise!)\, Linkerd lives and dies by the certificates it uses as its basis of identity for authorization decisions: mishandled certificates are one of the most common reasons for real-world issues in Linkerd installations. In this lightning talk\, we’ll take a look at one such failure from the real world\, with special attention to how it happened and what Linkerd is doing to improve things. Join us to\, hopefully\, avoid having to go through this yourself!

SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: Copacetic: Directly Patch Container Image Vulnerabilities - Jeremy Rickard\, Maintainer
DESCRIPTION:Maintaining secure container images and addressing new vulnerabilities quickly is a major challenge. To patch images\, end users face two options: wait for third-party authors to release updates\, which can take weeks\, or perform a full image rebuild\, a time and resource-intensive process.\nProject Copacetic (Copa) enhances the image patching process\, reducing turnaround time and complexity. It integrates easily into existing build infrastructure\, giving users greater control over their patching timeline and reducing costs.\nCopa scans container images using tools like Trivy to generate a vulnerability report and parses the report for necessary OS-level package updates. It applies these updates to the target image using Buildkit (Docker’s default builder) to create a new patch layer on the original image. Copa can even patch distroless images by leveraging external tooling.\nThe talk will overview Copa\, highlighting new features and future improvements.

SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: OCM: Global Deployments Made Easy With Declarative Policy-Driven Abstractions - Gaurav Jaswal\, Maintainer
DESCRIPTION:Deploying global applications across Kubernetes clusters in multiple regions is hard—but it doesn't have to be. In this lightning talk\, we'll show how open-source tools like Open Cluster Management (OCM)\, KubeVela\, and Crossplane can be leveraged to create a powerful cloud-native abstraction for policy-driven\, multi-cluster deployments.\n\nWe'll walk through a practical example that provisions a shared AWS Global DynamoDB table and deploys active-active application instances across regions—all defined declaratively. This approach streamlines global application rollout by cleanly separating infrastructure\, application\, and placement concerns\, enabling teams to focus on outcomes rather than platform plumbing.

SUMMARY:Project Lightning Talk: Konveyor: Mining Developer Wisdom to Modernize Legacy Apps with Kai - Jonah Sussman\, Developer / Approver
DESCRIPTION:At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2025\, we introduced Konveyor AI (Kai)\, a tool that pairs static analysis with LLM-powered agents to refactor legacy workloads for Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. Six months on\, Kai has evolved into a self-improving\, app modernization tool.\n\nKai now captures anonymized diagnostics\, agent actions\, and developer confirmations during real-world modernization work. Successful fixes are mined into hints that feed into future runs. Additionally\, a growing roster of specialized agents collaborates through an orchestrated workflow to apply fixes and leverage generated hints. The same insights surface directly in the IDE\, giving teams contextual recommendations the moment they need them.\n\nThe result is a virtuous learning loop: every migration feeds a growing knowledge base that accelerates the next one: securely\, at scale\, and cloud native. Come see how Kai can super-charge your journey from legacy to cloud-native in record time.

SUMMARY:Keynote: Supply Chain Reaction: A Cautionary Tale in K8s Security - Stacey Potter\, OpenSSF & Adolfo García Veytia\, Carabiner Systems
DESCRIPTION:Your Kubernetes cluster seems bulletproof: network policies\, mTLS\, no external API access\, GitOps workflows\, and automated CI/CD. But you're still vulnerable.\n\nThis talk follows a real-world attack where a hacker bypasses traditional defenses through supply chain exploits: poisoned commits\, tainted build tools\, malicious images\, and backdoored dependencies. A diligent DevOps engineer struggles to keep up.\n\nBut this isn’t just a tale of doom. Each attack vector is met with a practical counter using OpenSSF projects: Sigstore for image signing. SLSA attestations for build security\, OpenVEX/SBOM for dependency protection\, gittuf for source control\n\nThis session highlights how hardening the supply chain transforms into defense-in-depth without burdening the developer.\n\nTakeaways include:\n-How supply chain attacks bypass secure K8s setups\n-Actionable implementation and enforcement of OpenSSF tooling\, coordinated through the OSPS Baseline\n-Practical CI/CD and GitOps integrity improvements

SUMMARY:Sponsored Keynote: From Cloud-Native to Agent-Native: Context Engineering for Kubernetes - Idit Levine\, Founder & CEO\, Solo.io & Keith Babo\, Chief Product Officer\, Solo.io
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes is the leading foundation for cloud-native platforms\, but when it comes to agentic workloads\, critical gaps remain that prevent many organizations from getting agents to production. These gaps exist because agents and tools are not just containers\; they introduce new requirements such as dynamic identity for agents acting on behalf of users\, end-to-end observability for probabilistic workflows\, and context-aware networking for MCP and A2A protocols. Bridging this gap requires Kubernetes itself to be extended to become a context-aware runtime. Just as platform engineering abstracts complexity for developers\, context engineering extends Kubernetes to make AI and agentic workloads first-class citizens. This talk will focus on the key use cases\, requirements\, and solutions we see in the agentgateway and kagent communities that platform teams must navigate when bringing agents to production.

SUMMARY:Keynote: Scaling Geo-Temporal ML: How Pokémon Go Optimizes Global Gameplay With Kubernetes and Kubeflow - Yunpeng Liu & Andy Zhang\, Niantic (Scopely)
DESCRIPTION:Pokémon Go continues to engage millions of players worldwide with its location-based gameplay. Behind the scenes\, this presents a unique ML challenge: how to optimize real-world player experiences using massive volumes of geo-temporal data?\n\nIn 2024\, a team of ML practitioners at Niantic started tackling this by optimizing Raid Battle spawns—across dimensions of location\, time\, and difficulty—at a global scale spanning millions of S2 cells. The complexity of this problem goes beyond pure modeling: it also demands high standards for player satisfaction\, scalability\, and privacy protection.\n\nThis talk shares how the team designed a geo-aware recommender system and operationalized it in a cloud-native environment. Attendees will learn:\n\n- Modeling recommendations across spatial\, temporal\, and difficulty axes\n- Geo-temporal feature engineering at scale\n- Building and scaling recommender systems using Kubernetes and Kubeflow\n- MLOps lessons from one of the most popular location-based games

SUMMARY:Sponsored Keynote: Anchoring Trust in the Age of AI: Identities Across Humans\, Machines\, and Models - Yuan Tang\, Senior Principal Software Engineer\, Red Hat & Anjali Telang\, Senior Principal Product Manager for OpenShift Security and Identity\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Every revolution in computing has been defined by trust. Firewalls secured the internet\, while API keys and IAM roles helped shape the cloud. Today\, in the Kubernetes era of ephemeral workloads and Agentic AI\, trust is no longer just about people—human and machine identities now stand on equal footing. The challenge is ensuring auditability: knowing who or what is calling\, and being able to trace every interaction.\nThis keynote shows how projects like Kubernetes can anchor a new trust fabric. With SPIFFE and SPIRE providing cryptographic workload identities\, and Keycloak enabling another layer of identity and access control\, we establish an auditable chain of trust. Paired with KServe\, this fabric extends into AI serving so that every model\, explainer\, and pipeline step runs with verifiable identity. Together\, they make Kubernetes a secure\, accountable platform for the age of AI.

SUMMARY:Keynote: Maximum Acceleration: Cloud Native at the Speed of AI - Joseph Sandoval\, Principal Product Manager\, Adobe
DESCRIPTION:Cloud Native is not the end of the journey\; it has become the substrate for what comes next. Breakthroughs in AI promise a future where ideas move from research to reality at unprecedented speed\, but the gap between experimentation and production is widening. The challenge is not AI capability\, it is infrastructure. Today's platforms were built for predictable\, human-driven workloads\, not for adaptive models that demand scale\, resilience\, and portability. This keynote explores how the CNCF community can focus on the critical areas that matter most for AI adoption. It will highlight where attention and investment can deliver maximum acceleration\, ensuring that Cloud Native continues to evolve as the foundation for deploying and operating intelligent systems into the future.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Building Faster and More Efficient Computer Use Agents in Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION:AI Agents have become increasingly capable at performing automated tasks yet they’re limited by the explicit tools they’ve given. Computer use and code execution unlocks a new wave of agents for complex\, human-like tasks by enabling the LLM to execute code and commands as tools. With these new capabilities users are faced with security\, performance and efficiency trade-offs. Using Agent Sandboxes on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\, engineers can build isolated execution environments\n\nThis session showcases how Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a robust\, secure\, and efficient platform for orchestrating and executing agentic AI applications at scale.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Benchmarking GenAI Foundation Model Inference Optimizations on Kubernetes - Sachin Mathew Varghese\, Capital One & Brendan Slabe\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Foundation models are general purpose deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data capable of responding to a diverse set of tasks. To minimize the recurring inference costs\, such large model deployments are now being optimized in various ways to reduce the model computations without substantial loss in accuracy. These include techniques to optimize the attention mechanism like flash attention\, paged attention etc\, model parameter optimizations like quantization and other serving optimizations like in-flight batching\, speculative decoding\, disaggregated serving and other smart routing strategies. One of the biggest requirements to testing and deploying any such inference optimization technique is a consistent framework to measure and benchmark the inference performance. This talk introduces a Kubernetes SIG project to benchmark GenAI foundation model inference and validate the performance usability of inference optimizations in a standard manner for real world applications.

SUMMARY:Rust Is the Language of AGI - Michael Yuan\, Second State
DESCRIPTION:Strongly and statically-typed programming languages\, like Rust\, could be difficult for humans\, but they are especially well-suited for AI coding\, as the generated code can be validated by compilers for real-time feedback and reinforcement learning. However\, unlike Python\, there are few examples of Rust code in LLMs’ training corpora\, and hence limiting the LLM's capability in generating Rust code. This talk will discuss the open-source RustCoder project\, which provides an integrated agentic framework based on MCP for generating complete and valid Rust projects. It enables the following functionalities for IDEs and coding tools. 1. Generates a Rust Cargo project from a user request (aka vibe coding). 2. Compiles and executes Rust Cargo projects. 3. Automatically fixes compiler errors. The project is supported by two Linux Foundation Mentorship grants\, as well as content provided by the Rust Foundation.

SUMMARY:Anatomy of a Kubernetes Scheduler: Narrate Workloads Priority in Sequence - Hoon Jo\, Megazone
DESCRIPTION:By default\, Kubernetes workloads are distributed as evenly as possible across a pool of Kubernetes (worker) nodes. i.e.\, they are designed to be automatically deployed where they are best suited based on the state of each node. However\, sometimes we need to modify the code in order to ensure that the workloads are deployed where we want them to be\, and this can be as simple as 'nodeName'\, but sometimes we can use options like 'affinity' to ensure that they are deployed based on conditions. With all these different conditions\, which one will take more precedence? On the flip side\, we also add values like 'taints' to limit what we deploy to. If the condition you restrict are "SHIELD"\, then the condition you deploy can be likened to "SPEAR". Who win? Let's decode this paradox with an actual example in each case.

SUMMARY:Fix First\, Investigate Later: When an eBPF Rollout Brought Down Our Network - Zain Malik\, Exostellar & Grzegorz Głąb\, Whatnot
DESCRIPTION:When your production network suddenly starts dropping packets\, the last thing you expect is that your cloud provider quietly deployed a new monitoring tool. This talk shares our journey from mysterious outage to desperate fix to surprising discovery.\n\nIt started with alerts: packet loss spiking\, network throughput crashing from 800MB/s to near 250MB/s. No recent changes on our end. Hours into the crisis\, we discovered an unfamiliar DaemonSet running eBPF programs - Retina\, silently rolled out across our clusters. But here's the catch: we couldn't remove it. The daemonset was reconciled instantly back to original state after an update.\nWith users impacted and no time for root cause analysis\, we took a leap: build a mutation webhook to intercept and neuter this mysterious DaemonSet. It worked instantly - networks recovered\, crisis averted.\n\nOnly then could we investigate: How did an eBPF observability tool cause such devastation? And why didn't we know it was being deployed?

SUMMARY:Taming Telemetry at Scale: Platform Blueprints for Consistent Observability - Nancy Chauhan\, Agno & Marino Wijay\, Kong Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Observability is only as good as its implementation—and at enterprise scale\, it's often fragmented. With teams deploying their own OpenTelemetry (OTel) configurations\, inconsistencies arise in metrics\, logs\, and trace data\, making it harder to validate system health or pinpoint root causes. This talk explores how platform engineering teams can address these inconsistencies using a standardized architecture built on OpAMP\, Gateway API\, and service mesh technologies like Kuma and Envoy.\nWe’ll cover:\n- Common deployment patterns and team-specific observability needs\n- How Gateways and Meshes serve as rich telemetry aggregation points\n- How OpAMP helps centralize and automate OTel configuration management\n- Real-world examples of customer setups and results\n\nAttendees will walk away with reusable blueprints to align observability across teams while reducing MTTR and boosting operational clarity

SUMMARY:Unleash the Power of Inplace Pod Resource Resizing for Startup and Cost Optimization - Zhang Zhen & Yuxing Yuan\, Alibaba Cloud
DESCRIPTION:In-place pod resource resizing is a powerful K8S feature that can significantly accelerate application startup and improve autoscaling responsiveness. However\, its integration with k8s workload and tooling\, e.g. PodDisruptionBudget is lacking\, and support across programming languages and frameworks remains limited\, hindering widespread adoption.\n\nIn this session\, we share real-world experiences from Alibaba and RedNote on deploying in-place resource resizing. We will discuss challenges such as CgroupV1 compatibility issues\, and demonstrate language-level techniques to make resized resources available to applications\, including JVM parameter tuning and elastic heap management for Java workloads. Additionally\, we introduce a novel approach for dynamically resizing instances based on daily traffic patterns to optimize resource utilization. Finally\, we show how to automate in-place resizing during workload rollouts and to minimize disruption caused by resizing using OpenKruise.

SUMMARY:Platform Engineering: Day Zero\, The Origin Story - Murriel McCabe\, Google
DESCRIPTION:How do you get started with platform engineering if you don't have time and resources to build a platform? -- In an ideal world\, you are building a developer platform from the ground up with best practices\, scalability\, modularity\, automation\, self service capabilities\, and best-of-breed technology in a greenfield environment. In reality however\, there may be no paved roads\, golden paths\, guardrails\, or organizational buy in\, and the legacy of developers and sysadmins past may have generated mountains of debt that continue to accrue with compounding interest. In this talk\, we will build a platform engineering roadmap\, starting from your team or organization's current state - wherever that may be. You will have the opportunity to learn about some of the most common tools and technologies that go into building an internal developer platform\, and to explore approaches for championing a platform engineering mindset\, iterating on improvements to teams\, processes\, and technologies.

SUMMARY:Demonstration of Automatic Kubernetes Network Policies Generation - Boaz Michaely\, Red Hat & Adi Sosnovich\, IBM Research
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes networking by default is Malicious Actors’ heaven.\n\nWhy? Because by default\, any pod can send and receive traffic to and from any other pod\, ignoring namespace and privilege boundaries. External traffic in both directions is allowed as well\, as far as Kubernetes is concerned.\n\nIndeed\, best practices rightfully dictate that this default be modified\, using "Kubernetes Network Policies" .\n\nYet most teams find this too difficult to implement.\nAuthoring NetworkPolicy YAML is very challenging.\nBaseline/AdminNetworkPolicy fills a gap for cluster administrators\, but authoring these policies and understanding their impact is a new\, additional challenge.\nFurthermore\, policy authors may not know what the application’s communication needs are.\n\nWhat if there was a way to automatically produce tight network policy rules\, in YAML\, and see the impact of applied B/ANP network policies?\n\nJoin this session to see the magic yourself\, and learn how you can leverage this technology today!

SUMMARY:🚨 Contribfest: Making SlimToolkit Autonomous: Adding AI Assistant Mode and Built-in MCP Server - Kyle Quest\, MinToolkit
DESCRIPTION:The DevOps tools are often intimidating because you have to use them as CLIs that have many different options and users don't know about all their flags and the ones they do know about have constraints and gotchas that's hard to remember.\n\nWhen SlimToolkit got its interactive prompt mode its user experienced improved significantly. It was easier to discover the CLI flag and autocomplete many of them\, but still many users struggle with understanding what flags to use and when.\n\nWith this ContribFest session we'll build the AI Assistant Mode where SlimToolkit will be able to explain\, recommend and automatically select the right flags when you inspect\, debug and slim container images. We'll also add a built-in MCP Server\, so SlimToolkit can be used by AI agents.\n\nNo low level SlimToolkit\, container tech and AI expertise is required. You only need basic knowledge of Go. This is also an opportunity to learn how to build LLM-based AI assistants and agents as well as MCP Servers in Go.

SUMMARY:📚 Tutorial: Build-a-Bot Workshop: Enabling Trusted Agents With SPIRE + MCP - Maia Iyer\, Alan Cha & Mariusz Sabath\, IBM Research; Anjali Telang & Andrew Block\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Agentic platforms are redefining how cloud-native applications interact—but behind every action lies a critical question: who is allowed to do what\, and why? Emerging standards such as MCP allow AI agents to easily connect with tools\, but organizations looking to support agents must maintain security and transparency. They can do so by combining the power of OAuth 2.0 with strongly attested workload identity from SPIFFE.\n\nIn this hands-on workshop\, we’ll dive into the mechanics of secure workload identity for agents and tools—no prior experience required. Attendees will work hands-on with a working agentic stack\, including MCP for agentic tool-calling\, and integrate with cloud-native tools such as SPIRE for workload identity\, and Keycloak for user management. These existing technologies are key for enabling granular access control and rich audit trails across the full agentic flow. This workshop lays the foundations to building identity-first\, zero-trust agentic platforms.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Agent Identity and Access Management for Enterprise
DESCRIPTION:In this demo session\, we look at securing Agent and MCP communication by building around the construct of an Agent Identity using SPIFFE. We see how agent identity can be used to represent agents taking autonomous action and how a user can give authority to an agent to act "on-behalf-of" the user. On the MCP or API side\, we need to be able to distinguish when an agent is calling and apply policy to whether calls should proceed.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Simplifying Advanced AI Model Serving on Kubernetes Using Helm Charts - Ajay Vohra\, Amazon & Tianlu Caron Zhang\, Apple
DESCRIPTION:The AI model serving landscape on Kubernetes presents practitioners with an overwhelming array of technology choices: From inference servers like Ray Serve and Triton Inference Server\, inference engines like vLLM\, and orchestration platforms like Ray Cluster and KServe. While this diversity drives innovation\, it also creates complexity. Teams often prematurely standardize on limited technology stacks to manage this complexity. This talk introduces an innovative Helm-based approach that abstracts the complexity of AI model serving while preserving the flexibility to leverage the best tools for each use case. Our solution is accelerator agnostic\, and provides a consistent YAML interface for deploying and experimenting with various serving technologies. We'll demonstrate this approach through two concrete examples of multi-node\, multi-accelerator model serving with auto scaling: 1/ Ray Serve + vLLM + Ray Cluster\, and 2/ LeaderWorkerSet + Triton Inference Server + vLLM + Ray Cluster + HPA.

SUMMARY:Comms & Social Media - Why Does a Project Need It - Chris Short\, CIQ & Kaslin Fields\, Google
DESCRIPTION:An update to the Maintainer's Track session conducted at CNCF Maintainer Summit EU 2025. Kaslin Fields and I would be doing this updated version. CFP FOLLOWS Most projects have a website. Most projects attempt to establish some form of Social Media presence. However\, let's face the hard truth: communications for a project are challenging\, and we can encounter various pitfalls. Let's explore the mechanisms and processes you can use in a project to ensure better communication. We begin by identifying mechanisms and target groups for Kubernetes Contributor Communications\, what channels to use and will end in drafting social media policies and guidelines for the contributors when they are publishing comms in the name of a project. Also\, have you ever considered critical communications for a project - how do you handle communications if something critical is happening? After the session\, you have ideas for your project to move towards a more consistent and reliable communication.

While Dockerfiles simplified initial container creation\, they lack the abstraction needed to clearly delineate responsibilities between developers and platform teams. This often results in developers managing operational tasks like app containerization\, base image maintenance\, and remediating third-party vulns--time-consuming burdens that hinder productivity. In addition\, platform teams need to manage inconsistencies in Dockerfiles across teams which leads to difficult-to-manage images\, and troubleshooting complex builds consumes valuable developer time. Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNBs) provide a solution by enabling a clear separation of concerns. Operations teams can manage base images and security updates\, while developers focus on writing code. In this talk\, you'll learn how your organization can leverage CNBs to empower developers\, enhance security\, and optimize your containerization workflows.

SUMMARY:Talk To Your Dashboards: Using MCP and LLMs To Simplify Observability - Prashant Gupta & Raj Bhensadadia\, Apple
DESCRIPTION:In large-scale application services\, dashboards serve as windows into system health. But as the number of systems grow\, so does the complexity. Dashboards can become outdated\, and queries may drift over time. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a way to simplify the management of dashboards and alerts using natural language prompts. However\, integrating this capability into open-source systems is challenging to scale due to fragmented APIs. Enter\, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\, which addresses this challenge by exposing observability primitives—dashboards\, datasources\, alerts—through a standardized schema that LLMs can understand. In this session\, we'll demonstrate how MCP servers & clients can bridge LLMs with dashboard & alert management tools via natural language. You'll leave with practical techniques to integrate LLMs into your observability visualization stack like Perses—no custom wrappers\, & no brittle integrations.

SUMMARY:Taming Rollout Risks in Distributed Web Apps: A Location-Aware Gradual Deployment Approach - Angela Victorio\, JP Morgan Chase
DESCRIPTION:Deploying updates to web apps installed on managed client devices—such as airport kiosks or retail POS systems—comes with unique challenges. In this session\, we’ll share how we used Kubernetes\, Istio\, and CI/CD pipelines to implement a location-aware gradual rollout strategy. Rather than applying global traffic weights\, we targeted per-location percentages to minimize localized risk. The solution includes release-aware routing\, dynamic profile updates\, and flexible tooling—adaptable across tech stacks for anyone managing applications deployed to physical sites or edge clients.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: We build 0 vulnerability container images and so can you!
DESCRIPTION:Triaging and managing CVEs in container images can be a source of toil for users of open source applications - Do I need to worry about this vulnerability? Does this actually affect my application?\n\nAt Chainguard\, we approach solving this problem by building minimal container images leaving little to no known vulnerabilities so that you never need to triage them in the first place. But how does this work?\n\nIn this demo\, we'll explore how you can start building your own minimal vulnerability free images! We'll demo packaging an application from start to finish and cover some of the challenges of building minimal container images - how they work\, what makes a container image "distroless"\, and tricks for how you can apply this into your own build pipelines.\n\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Slurm Bridge: Slurm Scheduling Superpowers in Kubernetes - Alan Mutschelknaus & Tim Wickberg\, SchedMD
DESCRIPTION:If you are looking to run multi-node AI inference\, AI training\, or High Performance Computing workloads\, scheduling resources efficiently is imperative. Kubernetes was created to manage microservices which requires reliability\, but does not natively handle optimal workload placement. Slurm scheduling does account for the minutiae of node resources\, such as node hardware topology\, and other desired features such as workload planning\, fair use\, and batch type scheduling. With Slurm’s scheduling combined with fine-grained resource control offered by DRA drivers for CPUs\, NICS\, and GPUs\, Kubernetes will be leveled up to support large-scale\, granular resource scheduling. We demonstrate how the recently released Slurm Bridge\, one of the projects within SlinkyProject\, which uses the Kubernetes Scheduling Framework and the Slurm scheduler to drive multi-node workload placement decisions.

SUMMARY:The Myth of Portability: Why Your Cloud Native App Is Married To Your Provider - Corey Quinn\, The Duckbill Group
DESCRIPTION:We've been sold a lie. The cloud native ecosystem promises portability—write once\, run anywhere! Just containerize everything\, sprinkle some YAML\, and you're cloud-agnostic! Except you're not. This talk examines how cloud native applications become inadvertently locked to their cloud provider\, despite our best intentions. We'll dissect the subtle ways your "portable" application gets married to a specific cloud: from IAM systems that don't translate\, to provider-specific load balancers masquerading as standard ingress\, to that innocent-looking object storage bucket your app "temporarily" writes to. Through real-world examples and architectural patterns\, we'll explore the hidden dependencies that make cloud switching a multi-million dollar project\, why "cloud-agnostic" usually means "works poorly everywhere\," the true cost of maintaining actual portability (spoiler: it's more than just running containers)\, and when portability actually matters versus when it's expensive theater.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes IP Management: From Core Concepts To Strategic Solutions - Ivy Zhuang & Whitney Jenkins\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes' "IP-per-pod" model is often praised for simplifying container networking by providing a flat\, routable network that streamlines application deployment. But what happens when that "simplification" becomes a significant hurdle? Effective IP address management (IPAM) is challenging\, and cluster administrators must carefully plan network connectivity as these early decisions are often irreversible.\nThis talk will cover fundamental Kubernetes IPAM concepts\, including CNI plugin roles and IP assignment for pods/services/nodes. We’ll explore IPAM modes and address common challenges\, like IP exhaustion (CIDR allocation\, subnetting)\, dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) complexities\, and troubleshooting connectivity problems.\nFinally\, we will cover new Kubernetes IPAM features such as Extend Service IP Range alongside a general look at common IPAM solutions. Attendees will gain knowledge to design\, implement\, and troubleshoot robust and scalable solutions for their containerized applications.

SUMMARY:Strengthening Supply Chain for Kubernetes: Cross-Cloud SLSA Attestation Verification - Feynman Zhou\, Microsoft & Dahu Kuang\, Alibaba Cloud
DESCRIPTION:As software supply chain threats increase\, verifying the provenance and integrity of container images is essential for securing Kubernetes workloads. The SLSA framework provides a standardized way to achieve this through artifact attestations\, and platforms like GitHub have begun integrating provenance features into their CI/CD systems. However\, organizations often face practical challenges when verifying these attestations at deployment time\, particularly in controlled or restricted environments.\n\nIn this talk\, maintainers from Microsoft Azure and Alibaba Cloud will introduce upcoming support for SLSA attestation verification in the Notary Project and Ratify. We’ll demonstrate how these open-source tools enable policy-based verification of OCI artifact attestations across cloud providers and on-premise\, making them suitable for a wide range of enterprise and Kubernetes scenarios.

SUMMARY:Making Application Rollouts Observable\, Actionable and Boring - Vasudev Bongale\, LinkedIn
DESCRIPTION:Managing and understanding thousands of workload rollouts is challenging—especially in Kubernetes\, where the system is always converging\, making it difficult to track deployment origins\, changes\, and statuses. Developers and platform teams want clear answers: Did the rollout succeed? What changed? Is it stable? At LinkedIn\, we handle 50\,000+ app deployments weekly\, making visibility and quick debugging crucial. We’ve built a system that tracks every change—from pipeline-triggered rollouts and kubectl edits to controller-driven podSpec mutations—capturing both the source and the result. It helps surface failure reasons such as pod scheduling issues\, app/init container crashes\, and image pull delays. In this talk\, we’ll share our journey building a unified system\, categorizing failures\, simplifying interactions by abstracting Kubernetes\, and delivering out-of-the-box app health metrics. Our goal: to enhance platform reliability and streamline the developer experience with Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:Share With Care: Efficient Device Sharing With Guaranteed Resources Using DRA - Sunyanan Choochotkaew\, IBM Research & John Belamaric\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Divvying up a network card using Kubernetes is really hard to do. If you need to spin up virtual interfaces on top of a NIC\, limit their bandwidth\, and hand them out to different Pods\, you will have a rough time. Come find out how the Kubernetes project will make sharing network hardware just as easy as sharing node CPU and memory! And networking is just the initial use case - this functionality can work with any device. Being able to sub-divide devices will really improve utilization of your pricey hardware. In this talk\, we detail a new way to request resources from attached devices like NICs\, GPUs\, and DPUs. Building on the recently released Device Resource Allocation (DRA)\, this feature performs on-demand provisioning based on resource requests\, allowing a physical device to be independently shared among Pods multiple times. It extends K8s multi-tenancy to the sub-device level. We’ll dive deep and explore real-world use cases\, under the hood details\, and future extensions.

SUMMARY:From Bespoke To Bulletproof: SPIFFE/SPIRE With ESO for Enterprise Zero Trust - May Large & Ivy Moore\, State Farm
DESCRIPTION:At State Farm\, securing microservices across multi-cluster K8s environments demanded a robust zero-trust architecture. Our initial “bespoke” SPIFFE/SPIRE deployment provided workload identities but faltered under scale. To achieve enterprise-grade resilience\, we transitioned to an HA nestedSpire architecture\, enabling seamless integration with ESO for secure secret retrieval. This talk shares our journey\, from debugging 500 errors in ESO’s webhook-based SecretStore to scaling SPIRE agents. We’ll detail how we configured nestedSpire for HA\, integrated SPIFFE SVIDs with ESO’s webhook authentication\, and automated secret rotation to remove credential leaks. Attendees will learn steps for deploying nestedSpire\, troubleshooting common issues (like attestation failures). We’ll share lessons from our bespoke-to-bulletproof evolution. Whether you’re adopting SPIRE or optimizing an existing setup\, this talk offers a blueprint for building scalable\, secure zero-trust systems in Kubernetes.\n\n

SUMMARY:Manifesting Millions: No Luck Required\, Just Tenacity - Emily Long\, Edera
DESCRIPTION:When Edera's all-female founding team stepped into the world of deep enterprise technology in April 2024\, we weren't just solving the "unsolvable" problem of container isolation – we were dismantling every assumption about who builds category-defining infrastructure companies. In nine months\, we raised over $20 million across seed and Series A rounds\, but the path to that first million revealed brutal truths about what it takes for women to secure funding in tech.\n\nWhile the industry talks about the value of diverse teams in theory\, we're proving it works in practice\, delivering results that have customers asking "is this too good to be true?"\n\nOur approach turned conventional startup wisdom upside down. Instead of a technical CEO learning people skills\, we led with operational expertise and culture-first thinking – skills investors initially questioned but now credit as key differentiators. When you're already doing what nobody else is doing – building the first hardened runtime – why not push every boundary?\n\nThis talk exposes the unvarnished reality of raising that crucial first million: the investor meetings where we had to prove container isolation was possible before we could discuss market size\, the sleepless nights one month before I would have had to cash out my 401k to keep my family fed and the company alive\, and how being underestimated became our secret weapon. We'll share what it's like to be "very rare" – having all female founders in this industry – and how that rarity opened doors traditional approaches couldn't.\n\nThroughout this journey\, we've learned that exceptional execution speaks louder than any bias. But getting that first check? That required everything we had – and then some serious manifesting. We turned being "foundationally unique" into a license to take even bigger risks\, but more importantly\, we learned that founders get to choose their investors – not the other way around. While everyone chases the biggest names on Sand Hill Road\, we intentionally built our cap table with partners who shared our values and vision for what technology companies should be. Sometimes the best money isn't the most famous money.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nWhy choosing values-aligned investors over brand names builds stronger companiesConcrete strategies for female founders raising in enterprise techHow to weaponize skepticism when everyone thinks your problem is "unsolvable"The unexpected advantages of being the anomaly in investor meetings\nNo luck required – just the audacity to prove the impossible is inevitable.

SUMMARY:Lessons Applied Building a Next-generation AI Proxy - John Howard\, Solo.io
DESCRIPTION:As the industry's infrastructure requirements have progressed over time\, so have its proxies. Apache Traffic Server gave way to Nginx as traffic scales increased\, with Envoy eventually joining the picture to fill in the gaps of high scale micro-service architectures. A similar shift is happening today with the dramatic surge in AI infrastructure\, which have unique requirements to efficiently run. Intelligent request batching\, model-aware load balancing\, and token-based rate limiting are table stakes. Traditional proxies weren't designed for any of this. Like Envoy was built to fill the need for a micro-service optimized proxy\, a new data plane is needed to fill the need for an AI optimized proxy. In this talk\, I'll walk through the design decisions behind a new CNCF AI proxy built as part of kgateway. We'll explore what makes AI traffic unique\, as well as lessons learned from existing proxies\, and explore the tradeoffs needed to build an optimal AI data plane.

SUMMARY:Progressive Configuration Delivery for Zero-Downtime Cloud Workloads - Yuxing Yuan\, Alibaba Cloud & Hao Wu\, Bilibili Inc.
DESCRIPTION:On June\, 2025\, a misconfigured quota policy is deployed without proper validation in Google Cloud\, which caused widespread service disruption. Similar incidences related to un-safe configuration updates are reported by many cloud providers and users. Configuration updates in Kubernetes often lack the progressive delivery capability like code updates. While the community advocates generating new ConfigMaps with Deployment rolling updates\, this approach lacks systematic support and fails to address complex scenarios where configuration and image rollouts must be decoupled.\n\nIn this session\, we'll explore ConfigMapSet\, an OpenKruise innovation that redefines configuration management in Kubernetes\, supporting progressive delivery patterns combined with AI-ready orchestration. We'll demonstrate how this CRD-based solution enables zero-downtime configuration updates\, decouples config/image versioning\, and supports dynamic AI/ML workflows like distributed model inference.

SUMMARY:Shipping Secure\, Reusable\, and Composable Infrastructure as Code: GE HealthCare’s Journey With ORAS - Feynman Zhou\, Microsoft & Katherine Pitz\, GE HealthCare
DESCRIPTION:Before adopting a centralized approach\, engineering teams at GE HealthCare managed their Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments independently—leading to fragmentation\, inconsistent security practices\, and operational overhead. Each team had its own tools\, processes\, and storage methods\, making it difficult to scale\, enforce standards\, and ensure traceability across environments.\nTo solve this\, GE HealthCare introduced a shared delivery model built on ORAS and OCI registries\, enabling teams to package infrastructure definitions (e.g. Terraform modules) as OCI artifacts. This decouples infrastructure delivery from specific IaC tools\, while providing a secure\, consistent\, and versioned distribution mechanism.\nIn this session\, an engineer from GE HealthCare will share how they partnered with the ORAS community to build a SaaS platform that empowers teams to provision infrastructure using their preferred IaC technologies—without compromising on governance\, consistency\, or security.

SUMMARY:Plug & Play: How AI Agents Are Adapting - Ebony Louis\, Block\, Inc
DESCRIPTION:AI agents are supposed to make life easier\, but until now\, getting them to work with real world tools was a pain. If you wanted an agent to interact with your database\, or IDE\, you had to write custom API integrations for every single one. The thought of scaling this across multiple tools/ resources seemed impossible.\n\nBut what if you could just grab an AI agent\, plug it into whatever service you need\, and get to work\, without any extra coding or complex setup?\n\nIn this talk\, we'll cover how AI agents are becoming more modular with standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of being stuck with whatever knowledge they were trained on\, agents can now dynamically connect to APIs\, dev tools\, and cloud services on the fly. I'll show a live example of how the Kubernetes MCP server enables AI agents to discover clusters\, list pods\, etc\, making AI more flexible\, powerful\, and actually useful.\n\nIf you're ready to make AI agents work for you\, and not the other way around\, come see how the next generation is built to simply plug in and play.

SUMMARY:Routing Stateful AI Workloads in Kubernetes - Maroon Ayoub\, IBM & Michey Mehta\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes excels at stateless service routing - but modern AI workloads are not stateless. Generative workloads demand context-aware routing that maximizes performance while reducing costs.\n\nThis talk explores layered routing strategies for stateful LLM workloads on Kubernetes - from round-robin to full KV-Cache-aware load balancing. We’ll explain when each level applies\, and its effects on performance.\n\nBased on our experience developing llm-d - a framework using the K8s Gateway API Inference Extension\, a collaboration between Google\, IBM Research\, and RedHat - we’ll cover:\n- Why traditional Kubernetes routing falls short for generative AI\n- Routing patterns for long-context\, sessionful traffic\n- Global cache indices and local offloading for smart routing\n- Benchmarks showing latency\, cache hit rates\, and GPU utilization\n- Practical ways to adopt cache-aware routing without major infra changes\n\nIf you’re scaling multi-turn\, agentic\, or LLM-powered workloads\, this session is for you.

SUMMARY:GAMMA in Action: How Careem Migrated To Istio Without Downtime - Suren Raju\, Careem & Sergey Marunich\, Tetrate
DESCRIPTION:Careem\, the leading multi-service app in the Middle East\, handles over 5 billion Kubernetes-based service requests daily. As our platform evolved\, we began to outgrow the operational and extensibility constraints of our existing service mesh.\n\nThis talk shares how we executed an in-place\, zero-downtime migration to Istio within the same Kubernetes cluster—without increasing infrastructure cost or rewriting most service configurations. A key enabler was our early adoption of the Kubernetes Gateway API (GAMMA initiative). By building on vendor-neutral\, Kubernetes-native APIs for routing and traffic policies\, we achieved a “define once\, swap many times” model that allowed us to reuse the majority of our existing config during the transition.\n\nTo validate changes in production safely\, we integrated Flagger to implement metrics-driven canary rollouts and gradual traffic shifting.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes and etcd: Common Pitfalls and How To Avoid Them - Arka Saha & Nabarun Pal\, Broadcom
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever experienced a Kubernetes cluster that suddenly stops responding? As basic debugging steps\, you run kubectl commands\, but all of them result in a request timeout. So what is happening? Most likely\, etcd is failing.\nEtcd\, as we know\, is the sole distributed key-value store for Kubernetes\, responsible for continuously and consistently storing the state of the entire cluster. Every configuration\, workload information\, node registration is stored in etcd. So\, a degraded etcd cluster can cause stale reads and a possible cluster-wide outage since Kubernetes cannot reconcile or serve API requests.\nIn this session\, we’ll explore common causes of etcd failures that affect Kubernetes stability and performance. We’ll also discuss debugging methods and introduce tools like etcd-diagnosis to analyse the health of etcd in a running cluster. Finally\, we’ll share the best practices for operating etcd - upgrades\, backups\, recovery\, and key workarounds to ensure a resilient control plane.

SUMMARY:SIG Scheduling Intro & Updates - Kensei Nakada\, Independent & Dominik Marciński\, Google
DESCRIPTION:SIG Scheduling is responsible for the components that make Pod scheduling decisions in a Kubernetes cluster\, such as kube-scheduler for pod to node assignment\, Kueue for job queueing\, among other sub-projects too. In this session\, you will learn the basics of kube-scheduler and improvements the community was working on around scheduling performance and communication of scheduling decisions. We will also discuss challenges that scheduling is facing related to the DRA effort and limitations of pod-by-pod scheduling approach. Then we will talk about several major updates in kube-scheduler\, including the workload-aware scheduling effort that we want to kick off\, which is supposed to address the above challenges. Lastly\, we’ll see some updates from sub-projects\, such as FairSharing and HierarchicalCohort in Kueue.

SUMMARY:Instrumentation Score: The Difference Between Telemetry and Good Telemetry - Juraci Paixão Kröhling\, OllyGarden & Michele Mancioppi\, Dash0
DESCRIPTION:You've started with OpenTelemetry. Data flows. And reality hits hard. Did you instrument the right things? Is your telemetry consistent enough to analyze it easily? Do you have enough context to make sense of it? Observability efforts flounder by yielding too little insights compared to the associated costs. This session introduces the "Instrumentation Score\," an open standard to help you collect excellent telemetry. It assesses OpenTelemetry data quality\, consistency and completeness. Using OTLP analysis against best practices\, it offers actionable insights to identify gaps and prioritize enhancements in your instrumentation. Discover how the Instrumentation Score provides a clear path from uncertainty to effective observability. Learn to benchmark services\, systematically improve telemetry\, and gather truly actionable insights. Confidently mature your OpenTelemetry practice\, ensuring you're building high-value observability\, rather than just collecting data.

SUMMARY:QEMU in the Fast Lane: Accelerating KubeVirt Networking With eBPF - Daniel Borkmann & Anton Protopopov\, Isovalent at Cisco
DESCRIPTION:As organizations converge infrastructure by running VMs alongside containers in Kubernetes for cost savings and simplified operations\, networking performance remains a key challenge especially for latency and throughput sensitive workloads. In this talk\, we'll show how eBPF with AF_XDP can improve KubeVirt networking by putting QEMU in the fast lane (all without losing the ability to observe and enforce policy on traffic in the host unlike SR-IOV). We'll unpack an architecture built on Cilium\, netkit\, and upstream Linux kernel enhancements that enable KubeVirt Pods to launch QEMU/KVM instances backed by high-performance AF_XDP interfaces. You'll learn how our contributions to QEMU and the kernel enable this accelerated path\, and how it stacks up against KubeVirt defaults using real world benchmarks. Expect kernel spelunking\, performance graphs\, and a vision for adding a fast lane to VM networking.

SUMMARY:Integrating Data Center Observability Into Cloud Native Environment - Pedro Célestin\, CLDF & Julia Furst Morgado\, Veeam
DESCRIPTION:We’ve gotten good at observing applications in Kubernetes\, but the underlying data center often remains a black box. When the physical environment breaks\, it typically surfaces as a service issue\, not an infrastructure one.\nAt the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District (the CLDF) in Brazil\, a small team managing on-premises Kubernetes clusters faced this challenge. This talk shows how they addressed it using an open-source observability stack built on Redfish\, SNMP\, and Syslog\, funneled into a unified OpenTelemetry pipeline. Using tools like Telegraf Collector\, OpenTelemetry Collector\, Perses\, and OpenSearch\, they gained end-to-end visibility without commercial tools or silos.\nIf you run Kubernetes in on-premises\, retail\, or edge environments\, this session offers a practical\, vendor-neutral approach to bridging physical infrastructure with cloud-native observability workflows.

SUMMARY:The Cloud Is Lying To You: What It Really Takes To Run On-Prem - Paris Nakita Kejser\, Terma A/S
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever stopped to think about how much the cloud spoils us? Managed services\, infinite scalability\, auto-healing clusters\, instant backups — all just a click away. But what happens when you're told: no cloud\, no internet\, on-prem only? This session breaks down the brutal wake-up call that comes when cloud-native engineers are dropped into an air-gapped\, on-prem world. Drawing from real-world experience rebuilding Kubernetes infrastructure in restricted environments\, the talk explores what it really takes to replicate the cloud’s conveniences from scratch. From object storage and backup strategies to HA\, deployment scalability\, and monitoring — every layer of “magic” once taken for granted becomes a manual puzzle to solve. This talk is for anyone facing compliance constraints\, cost-driven on-prem mandates\, or just curious about what lies beneath the surface of their cloud-native stack. Warning: you may never see the cloud the same way again.

SUMMARY:It’s 2025; Why Are You OK With an Insecure Network? 🤯 - Alex Leong\, Buoyant
DESCRIPTION:It’s 2025. We’ve been talking about the fundamental insecurity and unreliability of the network for at least ten years\, and there are great options for addressing these issues these days. So why are folks still running applications without secure communications instead of taking advantage of these options? Are they trusting Kubernetes to protect them? Do they think security is too complex? Are we as an industry just doing a terrible job explaining that it’s important? In this session\, we’re going to tease apart the barriers to good security in the cloud. We’ll talk about meshes\, application code\, and memory safety\, but above all we’ll talk about operational simplicity and how the real key to security is understanding what’s happening in your application. You’ll leave this talk with actionable information about taking charge of your own security\, illustrated with examples using Linkerd\, but applicable everywhere.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: De-risking Your Virtualization\, AI\, and DevOps Strategies
DESCRIPTION:With the purchase of VMware\, Broadcom introduced a new consideration that every C-level executive needed to manage\; Risk. With most customers running a 2-vendor system for their storage\, compute\, and in some cases networking\; if a single vendor made an unfavorable change…the organization could pivot as-needed to the second vendor and continue operations. This was not the case with VMware\, where organizations had enjoyed over a decade of high-quality\, (relatively) low-cost\, high-capability virtualization that became the standard in the industry. Now that risk is a topic of conversation and consideration\, presenting the right second solution to a customer is key. They need usability\, capability\, extensibility\, and most of all flexibility to address not only Virtualization\, but AI and DevOps too.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Maximizing the Launch Reliability: Ensuring Stable Application Lift-off and Orbit on Kubernetes - Hiroshi Hayakawa\, LY Corporation
DESCRIPTION:Launch reliability is crucial for applications on Kubernetes that frequently restart. However\, applications often struggle to achieve optimal performance immediately after starting\, failing to handle the load and experiencing startup failures. This lack of launch reliability can result in service downtime during rollouts and make the horizontal pod autoscaler ineffective. To prevent these issues\, it's essential to tune the application and apply various practices within manifests.\n\nThis session will cover best practices for maximizing the launch reliability of applications on Kubernetes\, including application tuning\, appropriate resource allocation\, health check settings\, and techniques for automated warm-up. Additionally\, he will explore the practical use of Kubernetes' recent feature\, in-place pod resize\, particularly for CPU bursting at startup. By the end of the session\, you will gain actionable insights to enhance application stability and achieve flexible scaling.

SUMMARY:Rage Against the Machine: Fighting AI Complexity With Kubernetes Simplicity - Paul Yu & Sachi Desai\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:When you want a language model to do productive work\, providing it with the right context and grounding it with organizational data is key to preventing unwanted outputs. But building on foundational models can be complex and time-consuming – especially if you consider fine-tuning them on your own data. So\, most often\, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to provide the necessary context\, but building RAG pipelines– vector DBs\, embeddings\, indexing – can be a significant undertaking. How do we make this simpler and more approachable for developers starting to build AI applications? With KAITO\, a CNCF sandbox project\, you can start to tame the complexities and quickly build RAG pipelines using the RAGEngine CRD– reducing the need for complex coding. KAITO streamlines this process\, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management. Join us to learn how KAITO can simplify your RAG pipelines and accelerate your AI application development

SUMMARY:People-first Path To Cell-based Architecture - Martin Jones\, University of Edinburgh & Asanka Abeysinghe\, WSO2
DESCRIPTION:How do you move a 400-year-old university with 60\,000 students and staff from a monolithic ESB to a decentralized\, Kubernetes-native future—while keeping everyone engaged? The university’s API-first mandate exposed hundreds of services but surfaced bottlenecks in governance\, release cadence\, and team autonomy. By grouping related microservices\, APIs\, and policies into self-contained cells deployed on Kubernetes\, the team built a repeatable framework any squad could adopt in days. Provisioning fell from weeks to minutes\, cell & artifact level logging streamlined incident investigation\, deploying code couldn't be easier. Most important was how they succeeded: involving both business users and technical staff throughout the process\, they built engagement and trust together. Collectively developing lightweight playbooks meant they now have a blueprint for rolling out cell-based architecture in large\, federated organizations—starting with people\, not platforms.

SUMMARY:Straight Into the Deep End! Learning Kubernetes and Cloud Native From Scratch in Late 2024. - Éamon Ryan & Ayah Elshaikh\, Grafana Labs
DESCRIPTION:Many people attending KubeCon have spent years on both Cloud Native and Kubernetes - growing in their technical knowledge alongside the development of these concepts and technologies. But\, there are others for whom that isn’t the case. There are those who are just starting out their careers. And there are others who pivoted from industries that used older methods\, tools\, and technologies\, which is the case for one of the presenters. This talk aims to take those very people through what it’s like to dive head-first into Kubernetes and Cloud-Native in the modern day through the eyes of an engineer who did exactly that just recently – learning it in its mature form instead of iteratively along with it. It discusses the challenges and pitfalls that can be overcome or avoided. Additionally\, it discusses what’s changed in those years that has made things easier\, from the alternate perspective of an engineer who has been using Kubernetes for many years.

SUMMARY:Highly ScalableAI Search Engine and AI Data Lake With Kubernetes and LanceDB - Lu Qiu & Chanchan Mao\, LanceDB
DESCRIPTION:AI applications face retrieval challenges\, driving the rise of vector databases. However\, AI workflows demand more—feature store retrieval and analytical queries are just as essential. This often leads to AI data being stored in separate silos and queried using separate systems\, increasing cost and complexity.\nLanceDB eliminates this complexity by unifying vector search\, feature retrieval\, and SQL-based analytics within a single system\, built on the open-source Lance columnar format—the new standard for AI data. With Kubernetes-native autoscaling\, RAG and AI Agent applications embedding LanceDB can scale dynamically. This architecture redefines the performance-scale-cost curve\, delivering hyper-scalable AI applications at 10X better cost-efficiency. Leveraged KServe for model serving\, Postgres for metadata caching\, and Kubernetes native data caching solutions\, the impossible triangle of performance\, scale\, and cost is broken.

SUMMARY:I’ve Got 99 Problems and They’re All Controllers - Tim Goodwin\, UC Santa Cruz
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes is more than a container orchestrator\; it is a platform for building custom compute abstractions. This extensibility is rooted in its modular architecture\, where platform engineers can deploy custom resources and controllers to achieve specialized functionalities. Although powerful\, this extensibility creates new challenges: complex interactions between controllers can lead to unintended behaviors that can cause outages or data loss. Worse yet\, diagnosing these behaviors is notoriously difficult\; the loosely coupled\, asynchronous nature of the control plane offers poor visibility into the reconciliation process. This talk introduces Kamera\, a new observability toolkit that empowers developers to quickly diagnose issues in custom control planes by tracing causality across controller reconciliations and the environmental events that trigger them. We will also show how Kamera uses model-checking and simulation techniques to catch problematic emergent behaviors pre-deployment.

SUMMARY:Sync or Swim: Building Platforms You Can See - Heather Lee & Mike Cutsail\, Apple
DESCRIPTION:Platform teams today face a growing challenge: understanding what’s happening across sprawling\, multi-cluster environments where observability signals are scattered and context is missing. When infrastructure drifts or deployments fail\, engineers dig through logs and piece together fragmented views. This talk makes the case for a more connected\, observable platform\, showing how Crossplane\, OpenTelemetry\, and ArgoCD can work together to reduce blind spots in cluster provisioning. As the platform stack evolves\, tools like Crossplane put the Kubernetes API at the center of infrastructure provisioning. While powerful\, this shift complicates gaining a high level view of all moving parts. This session will focus on how declarative infrastructure and well-instrumented conditions improve visibility into system health and intent. Attendees will learn strategies for tracking object state\, correlating signals across clusters\, and building feedback loops that clarify operations.

SUMMARY:Modern PostgreSQL Authorization With Keycloak: Cloud Native Identity Meets Database Security - Yoshiyuki Tabata\, Hitachi\, Ltd. & Gabriele Bartolini\, EDB
DESCRIPTION:Still using usernames and passwords for DB access? In 2025\, that’s not just outdated—it’s a security liability. Static credentials are hard to manage\, rotate\, and audit\, especially in dynamic\, multi-tenant cloud-native environments. Traditional DB authentication no longer meets modern security and compliance needs. In this session\, Yoshiyuki Tabata and Gabriele Bartolini will show how to modernize PostgreSQL authorization by integrating it with Keycloak\, an identity and access management OSS. They’ll walk through externalizing authentication and authorization logic from the DB\, enabling centralized identity control across services. You’ll learn how to map Keycloak roles and groups to PostgreSQL privileges\, enforce fine-grained access policies\, and manage secure access in Kubernetes environments using CloudNativePG. They will explore how the innovative native OAuth support introduced in PostgreSQL 18 has the potential to transform the landscape of DB authentication in Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:The Good\, the Bad\, and the Ugly: Hacking 3 Cloud Native AI Services With 1 Vulnerability - Hillai Ben-Sasson & Nir Ohfeld\, Wiz
DESCRIPTION:With rising demand for AI workloads\, SaaS providers are evolving their K8s-based GPU offerings\, often built on NVIDIA Container Toolkit: the industry-standard framework for running GPU-based containers. In this talk\, we’ll show you how a single vulnerability in this fundamental framework impacted the entire cloud-native ecosystem – and how each environment handled a brand-new 0day.\nWe’ll walk through our discovery of this Pod-to-Node escape vulnerability\, and its impact across 3 different providers: Azure\, DigitalOcean\, and Replicate. Each case began with a weak Pod running our exploit – but outcomes varied widely. One led to minor impact\; another with lateral movement that triggered blue teamers\; and one with complete service takeover.\nJoin us to gain a firsthand look on how major cloud-native companies build their K8s environments\, and the anatomy of a container escape vulnerability in the wild. Finally\, learn how to build stronger K8s guardrails by examining the flaws we exploited.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS1): Automated Rightsizing for Istio DaemonSet Workloads - Artur Beznosyuk & Rohan Sood\, Verkada
DESCRIPTION:In Kubernetes\, DaemonSet workloads are constrained to a single set of CPU and memory requests across all nodes\, regardless of instance size. This one-size-fits-all approach can be risky—what works for a 2xlarge node may be insufficient or wasteful on a 48xlarge. To ensure critical DaemonSets like Istio's ztunnel always receive adequate resources\, especially during Ambient Mesh rollouts\, we built a mechanism to dynamically rightsize resource requests based on node capacity. In this poster session\, we’ll share how we implemented this automated rightsizing approach.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS10): Why We Replaced S3FS: Lessons From Building a Better Filesystem for AI Workloads on Kubernetes - Rui Su\, Juicedata\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Mounting S3-compatible storage via S3FS seems like an easy way to enable POSIX-like access in Kubernetes. But in real AI/ML workloads—e.g.\, training with PyTorch or TensorFlow—we hit major issues: crashes from incomplete writes\, vanished checkpoints\, inconsistent metadata\, and unpredictable I/O latency.\n\nThis session shares our journey from debugging S3FS failures to deploying a scalable\, POSIX-compliant file system that still leverages object storage. We’ll cover:\n\n- Benchmarks comparing S3FS and a user-space distributed FS\n- I/O traces showing metadata and small file pain points\n- Key design decisions for compatibility and performance\n- Kubernetes CSI and Operator integration for scale\n- Lessons from running it on 1\,000+ node AI training clusters\n\nIdeal for platform engineers\, MLOps\, and Kubernetes architects seeking reliable\, scalable storage for data-heavy workloads.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS2): Building a Community With an Open Datalab Platform - Frédéric Comte & Joseph Garrone\, Insee
DESCRIPTION:Statistical institutes and public organizations have faced increasing demand for secure\, scalable\, and user-friendly data platforms. At INSEE (France’s national statistics office)\, we created SSPCloud\, a collaborative cloud-native sandbox\, and Onyxia\, its open-source front-end\, to address these challenges.\n\nBut more than building platforms\, we built a community.\n\nThis poster will explore how we’ve fostered an open and international ecosystem across National Statistical Institutes (NSIs)\, researchers\, and developers. Our approach combines transparency\,\, and a design philosophy that places non-expert users at the center. Onyxia abstracts the complexity of the underlying cloud infrastructure while exposing its mechanisms for those who want to dig deeper.\n\nSSPCloud and Onyxia are now used as a shared reference by a growing number of NSIs beyond Europe\, promoting interoperability\, reproducibility\, and innovation—all while respecting data sensitivity and sovereignty. SSPCloud serves as the sandbox infrastructure for Eurostat’s AIML4OS project\, while Onyxia has been identified as a reference software solution by the UN Global Platform.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS3): From Noise To Clarity: Humanizing Observability in Cloud Native Systems - Nikita Verma\, Zscaler & Harshita Varma\, Juspay
DESCRIPTION:As cloud-native environments scale in complexity\, observability is no longer just about collecting logs\, metrics\, and traces—it’s about making sense of them. While modern observability stacks deliver a wealth of data\, the real challenge is translating this information into actionable insights that everyone on the team can understand and use\, from SREs and developers to business stakeholders.\n\nThis talk explores the next evolution: From Noise to Clarity. We’ll dive into practical strategies and open source tools (like OpenTelemetry\, Prometheus\, and emerging AI/LLM-powered solutions) that help demystify observability data. Attendees will learn how to:\n\nCorrelate signals across distributed systems for a unified view\n\nUse AI and LLMs to generate human-friendly explanations of complex incidents\n\nBuild dashboards and alerts that surface root causes\, not just symptoms\n\nEmpower teams to act quickly and confidently—regardless of their observability expertise\n\nWe’ll showcase real-world examples.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS4): Optimising OpenCRVS Deployment With Kubernetes: Lessons for DPI Adoption in the Global South - Andrew Amstrong Musoke & Samuel Emmanuel\, Upanzi Network
DESCRIPTION:Open source Digital Public Infrastructure\, DPI is the leading approach for lowering the barrier of digital transformation for governments in the global south and boosting inclusive socio-economic development.\nLower technical skills\, heterogeneous digital infrastructure and fragmented digital sovereignty significantly hinder the adoption and scalability of critical public services like OpenCRVS\, a project for civil registration and vital statistics.\nLearn how a Kubernetes based architecture addresses these challenges\, using OpenCRVS as a case study to demo a shift from inefficient\, manual deployments with artisanal scripts to an out-of-box and automated process while reducing the resource footprint. Explore the practical strategies employed to optimize and deploy OpenCRVS in a heterogenous air-gapped environment\, reducing development and deployment times from months to days while enhancing security and maintainability. The lessons we gleaned are recommendations for DPIs in general.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS6): Private Computation Spaces Via Confidential Containers and KubeStellar - Salman Abid & Shuangyu Lei\, Cornell University
DESCRIPTION:The recent popularity of generative AI in sensitive domains such as healthcare and digital agriculture presents new challenges for protecting user data and model intellectual property. We propose Private Computation Spaces (PCS)\, a distributed confidential computing framework that enables secure deployment of generative AI models inside hardware-protected enclaves. We use two open-source CNCF projects\, Confidential Containers and KubeStellar\, to enable multi-cluster orchestration particularly for digital agriculture workloads. The proposed framework is designed with agricultural users/researchers in mind and allows researchers to rapidly deploy/manage computational AI models for plant disease detection using NASA imagery without retaining confidential stakeholder information. The PCS enhances user trust\, supports disconnected operation in rural environments with KubeStellar\, and generalizes to other privacy-sensitive domains as a platform.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS7): Security Attacks on Kubernetes Pods - Yue Zhang\, Auburn University
DESCRIPTION:While Kubernetes-based computing infrastructure aids practitioners in rapid deployment of software\, security weaknesses can make the computing infrastructure susceptible to security attacks. In order to secure their computing infrastructure\, practitioners can benefit from a systematic analysis that derives what configuration parameters can facilitate security attacks related to pods\, which is the most fundamental deployment unit of Kubernetes. We conduct an empirical investigation where we derive 7 security attacks\, characterize the derived attacks using the MITRE ATT&CK framework\, and identify pod-related configuration parameters that facilitate each of the attacks. We find 6 of the 7 attacks can be conducted using combinations of configuration parameters\, whereas one attack can be conducted using only one configuration parameter.\n\nAs part of our investigation\, we evaluate if t-way covering array\, large language models\, and existing static application security testing tools can detect the identified combinations of configuration parameters that facilitate security attacks. With respect to average precision and average recall\, t-way covering array with t=4 performs the best among the investigated techniques\, achieving average precision and average recall of 0.83 and 0.68\, respectively. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations for practitioners on how to securely develop configuration scripts so that the identified attacks can be mitigated.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS8): The Handoff Pipeline: Using Pull Requests to Manage Integration Points - Prajakta Kashalkar-Joshi & Socheat Sou\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:When working on a cloud-native product that is an aggregate of separate products\, each with their own cadence\, clear communication is critical to smooth integration. Ideally\, each product team wants to know when the other related products have published a new release and if it's ready to be integrated with their product. It becomes an exponential\, logistical nightmare to have each team subscribe to notifications of each other team. Using an "integration repository" helps solve both the business and technical needs of product integration and currency. In this talk\, learn how the Fusion DevOps team turned the pull-request into a mechanism for streamlining team handoffs\, notifying the appropriate focals\, and clearly defining boundaries of responsibilities between teams.

SUMMARY:🪧 Poster Session (PS9): Wasm X GitOps: WebAssembly Components With Argo and Helm - Eric Gregory\, Cosmonic
DESCRIPTION:Running WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes is much simpler than even a year or two ago. As the WebAssembly ecosystem standardizes and matures\, integrations with the wider world of cloud native tooling make it possible to package and manage both infrastructure primitives and WebAssembly components using GitOps patterns and standard tooling like Helm and Argo.\n\nThis poster session demonstrates how wasmCloud\, Argo\, and Helm can work together for a smooth\, GitOps approach to deployment and management for highly efficient\, polyglot server-side WebAssembly applications. You’ll walk away ready to apply these techniques in your own environments.

SUMMARY:Keynote: Cloud Native for Good - Faseela K\, Ericsson Software Technology; Omar Mohsine\, United Nations; Roberto Machorro\, Child Rescue Coalition; Bodhish Thomas\, Open Healthcare Network; Jayson Workman\, American Red Cross
DESCRIPTION:Cloud native technologies have revolutionized industries across the board—but what about their role in solving real-world societal challenges? While we often celebrate enterprise success stories\, the true transformative power of Kubernetes and its wider ecosystem is also unfolding in unexpected and deeply impactful ways.\n\nDid you know Kubernetes is helping over 30 governments map\, monitor\, and improve internet access for schools? Or that KubeVirt and Longhorn have helped rescue 3\,800+ children from abuse\, leading to the arrest of over 16\,700+ online predators in over 105 countries? Or that Prometheus and OpenTelemetry not only power platforms that have saved millions from floods and pandemics\, but—closer to home—team up with Kubernetes to steer the fleet\, check its vitals\, and trace every heartbeat of 2000+ TeleICU Bed edge nodes in perfect rhythm across geographically dispersed locations? Or that Kubernetes\, ArgoCD\, and other CNCF tools power mission-critical services like blood supply management\, disaster response\, and emergency training—stretching every dollar to maximize humanitarian impact?\n\nIn this compelling panel\, Faseela brings together real-world end-user stories from around the globe\, showcasing how open source and cloud-native technologies are being harnessed to tackle humanitarian issues. From disaster response and education to public health\, child safety\, and environmental conservation\, learn how organizations are using cloud-native tooling to collaborate at scale\, unlock powerful analytics\, and reallocate resources from overhead to frontline impact.\n\nWith expert speakers from diverse domains\, this session offers a unique look into how Kubernetes and its ecosystem are driving innovation and ultimately driving social good\, sustainability and inclusivity beyond the enterprise world!

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Beware Argo CD App Promotion Anti-Patterns and Embrace Scalable Promotion in GitOps Cloud
DESCRIPTION:We all love and use Argo CD to sync our applications to clusters. With thousands of applications\, what's the best way to promote changes from one application to another? In 2025\, anti-patterns abound with many teams adopting backwards and even dangerous methods to orchestrate changes across applications. In this session\, we'll expose anti-patterns like promoting SHAs\, misusing branch environments and many more. We’ll replace these with a pathway to handling app and environment promotion that is flexible\, easy to configure\, and incredibly scalable\, even to the point of handling thousands of deployment targets with a couple of simple Kubernetes CRDs for configuration.\n\nWe'll show how the value of abstracting clusters into environments\, how to build relationships and customize diffing between applications\, and demonstrate how to streamline your change management in 2026.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Models as Microservices\, Platforms as Partners: Collaboratively Building ML Infra at Hinge - Stephanie Pavlick\, Hinge
DESCRIPTION:What does it take to build an online model serving platform that ML engineers actually want to use? At Hinge\, we’re building an ML platform that smooths the rough edges of OSS Kubernetes-native tools with interfaces aligned to internal conventions like gRPC and OTel\, so ML engineers can focus on models that shine. In this talk\, Stephanie Pavlick shares how Hinge’s AI Platform Core team designed a self-serve platform for deploying and monitoring online models using Ray Serve\, MLflow\, Grafana\, and more. The platform enables ML engineers to deploy models as microservices without touching Kubernetes or Helm while offering fine-grained observability and standardized SLIs. But the story is more than just tooling. Stephanie will share how the team cut model production timelines by over 40% through early partnerships and a focus on developer experience. Along the way\, they fostered a culture of collaboration and trust that helped drive broader adoption across Hinge’s engineering org.

SUMMARY:“Do You Even Merge?” - Welcome To Maintainers Life\, Please Bring Snacks and Boundaries - Nitish Kumar\, Akuity; Verónica López\, AuthZed; Lee Calcote\, Layer5
DESCRIPTION:Open Source maintainers are often seen as gatekeepers of progress\, expected to fix bugs\, review PRs\, design features\, answer questions\, and keep the community happy. But behind that façade is often an unexpected reality\, especially in high-velocity CNCF projects.\n\nIn this talk\, we will share what it’s like to maintain a CNCF Graduated project\, not just the technical side\, but the human side: how we keep the project growing\, prioritize responsibly\, and how governance structures like SIGs help scale responsibilities. You’ll hear stories\, lessons\, and hard truths that rarely make it into blog posts.\n\nThe more successful a project becomes\, the harder it gets to sustain\, and that’s something we don’t acknowledge enough. If you’ve ever wondered why your issue didn’t get a response\, why a feature was declined\, or what “being supportive” really looks like in open source\, this talk will help you understand the maintainer’s side and maybe rethink your own role in the ecosystem to support them.

SUMMARY:The OS Behind the Curtain: What Happens on Your Nodes When Things Happen in Your Cluster - Joe Thompson\, Clarity Business Solutions
DESCRIPTION:Sometimes it seems like magic when we deploy a service with a few lines of YAML and Kubernetes starts actually routing traffic to our pods -- or we create those pods with a certain configuration and Kubernetes sets everything up for us. But what is Kubernetes actually *doing*? In many cases\, it's actually the node's OS that does the heavy lifting behind the scenes\, through existing OS features that were used to manage workloads for years before Kubernetes appeared. In this session\, Joe pulls aside the curtain to give you a tour of the OS nuts and bolts behind the magic of services\, pods\, and other mystical Kubernetes incantations. Whether you're a novice who's never heard of cgroups or iptables\, or a more experienced user who just wants to learn how everything you already knew ties together\, you'll see what your nodes do to make Kubernetes possible and gain a deeper understanding of why certain things in your cluster work the way they do.

SUMMARY:Agent-Driven MCP for AI Workloads on Kubernetes - Ganeshkumar Ashokavardhanan & Qinghui Zhuang\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Managing AI inference workloads on k8s is hard: you need to choose the right GPU instance type\, configure services\, balance costs vs. performance\, write tedious YAML\, and continuously monitor utilization and inference latency. What if you can leverage AI to determine these factors with high accuracy? Learn how to build an end-to-end AI-PaaS on k8s by combining cloud-native tools\, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers\, and intelligent agents. We will show how an agent can resolve a simple text command (“deploy llama-3-70b-chat”)\, call out to external MCP metadata services (e.g. HuggingFace)\, calculate the optimal GPU topology\, and provision nodes via the Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator\, deploy the model\, and then automatically scale based on real-time metrics -- all without hand-editing a single manifest. We will also discuss how to address underspecified aspects (like model quantization levels\, cost vs latency tradeoffs)\, and the guardrails needed to validate before deploying.

SUMMARY:Offline\, Not Off-Limits: Edge Fleet Management With Argo CD - Alexander Matyushentsev\, Akuity
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes at the edge is no longer experimental - it’s becoming the default choice for various use cases. As adoption grows\, new challenges emerge: managing scale\, handling connectivity issues\, and delivering updates. Sparse\, unreliable internet connectivity - requires a rethinking of typical GitOps workflows. This talk presents a production-grade\, end-to-end architecture with Argo CD at the center\, enabling centralized management of a fleet of disconnected or intermittently connected clusters. The design includes an in-cluster Git server and container image registry to ensure local availability of both manifests and images during offline operation. We’ll cover controlled sync strategies\, secure update propagation during reconnection windows\, and how to bootstrap new clusters in isolated environments. The talk concludes with a live demo of the full setup\, and attendees will walk away with a reference implementation they can adopt for industrial\, telco\, or remote field deployments.

SUMMARY:Strengthening Kubernetes Trust: SIG Auth's Latest Security Enhancements - Anish Ramasekar\, Mo Khan\, Stanislav Láznička\, Rita Zhang & Peter Engelbert\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:SIG Auth is leading efforts to strengthen Kubernetes’ authentication and authorization foundations. This session covers recent and upcoming features shaping security across the stack. Secure image pulls are being enabled using ephemeral ServiceAccount tokens\, reducing reliance on long-lived secrets and node-scoped credentials. Kubernetes is gaining a new mechanism for provisioning X.509 certificates directly to pods via the kubelet\, enabling strong mTLS authentication and service-to-service communication. Kubelet serving certificate validation is being hardened to prevent node impersonation\, especially in dynamic or on-prem environments. In resource management\, DRA adds support for privileged admin access to devices in use\, enabling secure diagnostics without weakening isolation. We’ll also cover current and future improvements in authorization\, such as tighter policy for image pull operations. Join us to learn how these efforts are improving the trust model across Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:Retrofitting OTEL Collectors & Prometheus - How To Overcome Scale/Design Limitations - Vijay Samuel & Sandeep Raveesh\, eBay
DESCRIPTION:We have all run into this problem - "OTEL Collector/Prometheus does things differently and it doesn't fit my organization's design or can't really scale to my need". Once that statement is made\, the almost immediate goto is to either customize or ditch the project completely. With some of the connectors/processors in OTEL we ran into this issue where we were unable to operate them. Ex:\n* eBay's span traffic spans multiple kubernetes clusters and multiple regions. Service graph connector would need to see spans globally routed into a single collector. At scale\, this requires a lot of memory to account for all kind of trace durations.\n* Prometheus has no support for long term retention for exemplars.\n\nIn this talk we discussion practical solutions of how we leveraged our Clickhouse based internal tracestore to provide spans to servicegraph connector in a sustainable way to generate metrics and how we used clickhouse to provide long term retention of exemplars.

SUMMARY:Rearchitecting Compute at Coinbase: Migrating To Karpenter for Fast\, Reliable Scaling - Frances Chong\, Coinbase
DESCRIPTION:At Coinbase\, we run thousands of workloads - from high-throughput APIs to long-lived blockchain nodes. As traffic patterns scale due to crypto’s volatility and expectations around reliability and cost got tighter\, our prior cluster setup using cluster-autoscaler and EKS managed node groups couldn’t strike the right balance. This talk covers why we moved to Karpenter (including pain points around scaling latency\, bin packing\, and satisfying unique topology and hardware requirements) and what it took to get there. You’ll learn how we implemented a scalable and tag-driven EC2NodeClass abstraction\, tuned Karpenter for burst elasticity\, and built observability and guardrails to make scaling safer and more predictable. Finally\, we’ll share lessons from overly aggressive node consolidation\, launch template drift\, VPC-CNI coordination\, and how we’ve adapted our platform to support rapid\, responsive scaling under crypto-scale pressure.

SUMMARY:Making Platform Engineering Accessible: From Newcomer To Power User - Luke Philips\, Independant & Julia Furst Morgado\, Veeam
DESCRIPTION:Platform engineering promises accelerated developer productivity\, but complex abstractions often create barriers instead of removing them. How do you design platforms that welcome newcomers while empowering experienced users?\n\nDrawing from real-world implementations at CNCF Orgs and community insights from organizing major cloud native events\, we'll demonstrate progressive platform experiences that grow with developers. Learn about abstractions from Helm\, ArgoCD\, Dapr\, or CNOE that level up without sacrificing flexibility\, implement progressive patterns\, and create feedback loops ensuring platforms evolve with user needs.\n\nThrough practical examples whether GitOps or Dapr or other enablers we'll show how to build platforms serving both overwhelmed newcomers and power users demanding control. Get actionable strategies for making sophisticated platforms approachable and effective.

SUMMARY:Maximizing Global Potential: Cost-Optimized\, High-Availability Workloads Across Regions - Wei Jiang & Jingkang Jiang\, CloudPilot AI; Michael McCune\, Red Hat; Praseeda Sathaye\, Amazon
DESCRIPTION:Running stateless workloads like AI inference and video encoding demands significant compute\, which can be costly and subject to shortages in a single region. Distributing workloads across regions and cloud providers helps optimize both cost and availability.\n\nThis session explores how multi-cluster scheduling and Karpenter enable dynamic provisioning across preemptible (cost-effective but region-limited) and non-preemptible node VMs. By integrating with cloud providers’ pricing and availability APIs\, we present a unified strategy for cost-efficient scheduling and autoscaling without sacrificing availability. As we scale resources across regions and providers\, we ensure traffic gets routed the right way - so your service stays responsive and efficient no matter where the pods are running.\n\nAttendees will learn how to design a resilient\, multi-cloud architecture that adapts to fluctuating costs while ensuring seamless workload execution.

Customers increasingly rely on reservations and sophisticated capacity management to navigate this reality\, especially for scarce\, specialized hardware like GPUs & TPUs. This demands evolving Kubernetes beyond single clusters to become the "operating system of the cloud for distributed systems"–what we call "Ambient Global Compute". As the engineering director leading OSS K8s at Google\, I will share a comprehensive view on how K8s is adapting to orchestrate workloads across non-elastic\, global environments. Learn about initiatives supporting this shift & how they fit together to support unified multi-cluster\, often multi-cloud\, deployments\, including: DRA\, [Multi-]Kueue\, Karpenter/ ComputeClasses\, MCO\, ArgoCD\, & more. This talk equips attendees to understand and leverage Kubernetes' evolution for modern\, demanding workloads\, and return to a simpler mental model despite growing complexity in infrastructure.

SUMMARY:Managing a Million Infra Resources at Spotify: Designing the Platform To Manage Change at Scale - Oliver Soell & Fredrik Sommar\, Spotify
DESCRIPTION:Spotify’s “Declarative Infrastructure platform” (a Kubernetes-based infrastructure management platform) enables Spotify’s developers to manage almost a million infrastructure resources\, and enables tens of Platform teams to support first- or third-party resources through the platform. The platform empowers Platform teams to manage all resources of a specific type\, like Spotify’s Storage team managing all Bigtable instances.\n\nYou may ask\, how do those Platform teams plug into the platform to support their specific resources? Depending on their use case\, they can mix and match technologies such as KCC (GCP Config Connector)\, kro (Kube Resource Orchestrator)\, K-Poperator (an internal Spotify operator framework)\, and Kubebuilder to meet their needs.\n\nIn this talk you’ll learn how these platform primitives are used by Spotify’s platform teams\, how these primitives support Spotify’s platform principles\, and lessons learned from 5 years of running the platform.

SUMMARY:Quantum-Resistant Kubernetes: Realities\, Risks & (Versioning) Pitfalls - Fabian Kammel\, ControlPlane
DESCRIPTION:Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is no longer theoretical. With Go 1.24+ enabling ML-KEM by default\, Kubernetes v1.33+ inherits significant quantum resistance for key exchange. This talk dives into the practical realities. We'll briefly cover the current state of PQC standardization\, such as ML-KEM (FIPS-203) and then critically examine real-world implications: how K8s "accidentally" already benefits from PQC key exchange\, the subtle but critical downgrade risks from mismatched Go versions (e.g.\, Go 1.23's `X25519Kyber768Draft00` vs. 1.24's `X25519MLKEM768`)\, and the "tldr.fail" issue where large PQC key shares can break TLS handshakes due to packet size limits. We'll explore these challenges with evidence from the K8s ecosystem\, offering insights for maintainers and advanced users navigating the PQC transition.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Three Well-Lit Paths to Scalable LLM Inference with llm-d on Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION:As GenAI workloads move from prototypes to production\, engineering teams hit scaling walls: exploding GPU costs\, uneven latency\, and bloated\, black-box inference stacks. In this live demo\, Red Hat will explore these three well-lit paths for scaling LLM inference on Kubernetes using the open-source llm-d framework. Each path addresses a specific challenge in real-world GenAI operations:\nIntelligent Inference Scheduling reduces latency through prefix cache–aware routing and prompt/session stickiness.\n\n\nPrefill/Decode Disaggregation improves GPU efficiency and reduces tail latency by decoupling compute stages.\n\n\nWide Expert Parallelism unlocks the ability to deploy Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with high throughput across multiple replicas.\n\n\nThe session will feature a live demonstration of llm-d\, deployed with vLLM\, Prometheus\, and Grafana. Attendees will discover how to disaggregate LLM workloads into composable services and gain actionable insights for implementation on any Kubernetes platform. A key highlight will be a walkthrough of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model configuration\, demonstrating llm-d's efficient scheduling of models using expert parallelism across different nodes\, leveraging AI accelerators.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: The DRA Paradigm Shift: Request a Capability\, Not a Node
DESCRIPTION:For years\, scheduling GPUs in Kubernetes meant one thing: forcing a direct link between your workload and a specific node. Through a brittle web of taints\, tolerations\, and nodeSelectors\, we've been telling our pods where to run\, tightly coupling our applications to the physical infrastructure beneath them. This operational model is inefficient\, hinders portability\, and doesn't scale.\n\nIn this session\, you'll see a live demonstration of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)\, a new Kubernetes standard that fundamentally changes how we orchestrate specialized hardware. We'll show you how to stop targeting nodes and start requesting capabilities. Using a declarative ResourceClaim on GKE to request specific NVIDIA GPU attributes\, we can let the Kubernetes scheduler intelligently match your workload with the right hardware anywhere in the cluster. This is the future: a truly portable\, flexible\, and automated approach to managing high-value resources.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Beyond Grep: Interactive\, Offline Analysis of Kubernetes Failures
DESCRIPTION:Static support bundles capture logs and resource dumps\, but they lack the interactivity needed for real analysis. To fully understand a Kubernetes failure\, engineers must query the API as it existed during the incident. This talk introduces a technique that turns static bundles into interactive\, queryable Kubernetes environments.\n\nWe’ll start with troubleshoot.sh\, which creates a diagnostic bundle of the failing cluster. Then we’ll show troubleshoot-live\, which ingests that bundle and launches a local Kubernetes API server and etcd instance\, rehydrating the cluster state. The result is a high-fidelity\, offline replica accessible via kubeconfig with kubectl or any compliant tool. This enables interactive debugging\, post-mortem analysis\, and automated triage completely offline and without production access.\n\nFinally\, we highlight that by replaying real-world failures safely and consistently\, teams can train AIOps pipelines\, experiment with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\, and develop advanced Agentic Workflows. This capability improves day-2-day troubleshooting while paving the way for next-gen intelligent Kubernetes operations.\n\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:No More GPU Cold Starts: Making Serverless ML Inference Truly Real-Time - Nikunj Goyal\, Adobe & Aditi Gupta\, Disney Plus Hotstar
DESCRIPTION:Serverless ML inference is great but when GPUs are involved\, cold starts can turn milliseconds into minutes. Whether scaling transformer models or using custom inference services\, the startup latency caused by container initialization\, GPU driver loading\, and heavyweight model deserialization can kill real-time performance and cost you tons of money. In this talk\, we'll break down the anatomy of GPU cold starts in modern ML serving stacks including why GPUs introduce unique cold-path delays\, how CRI and device plugins contribute to it\, and what really happens when a PyTorch model boot-up on a fresh pod. We’ll walk through production-ready strategies to reduce startup latency: - Pre-warmed GPU pod pools to bypass init time - Model snapshotting with TorchScript or ONNX to speed up deserialization - Lazy loading techniques that delay model initialization until the first request Thus helping you eliminate cold start pain and keep your services fast\, efficient\, and production-ready.

SUMMARY:Tuning GenAI Workloads on Kubernetes: What Actually Works (and What Doesn’t)? - Ishaan Sehgal\, Omnara & Brian Lockwood\, NVIDIA
DESCRIPTION:Curious about what really moves the needle for GenAI performance on Kubernetes? We put Skyhook\, a Kubernetes-native OS package manager\, and Kaito\, the CNCF Sandbox AI workload operator\, through their paces. Running LLaMA\, Falcon\, and Phi-4 workloads on both single and dual GPU nodes\, we tweaked everything from kernel flags and GRUB settings to sysctl values and GPU clock locking.\nThe real breakthrough wasn’t in the numbers\; it was in the process. We developed a declarative\, GitOps-ready workflow that makes infrastructure benchmarking safe\, repeatable\, and easy to adopt.\nIn this session\, we’ll walk you through real benchmark data and Grafana dashboards\, share reusable YAML examples for OS and GPU tuning\, and introduce a practical A/B testing framework for GenAI. You’ll leave with a clear sense of what’s actually worth tuning\, and what you can safely ignore\, when running LLMs on Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:But What About Reliability? - The Multi-Million Dollar Kubernetes Cost Optimization Question - Zain Malik\, Exostellar & Nibir Bora\, Clean Compute
DESCRIPTION:“But what about reliability?” We heard this question 865 times when staring at 9% CPU utilization. Every time followed by a VM-era horror story or a revenue shield - "We bring in millions in revenue\; we deserve idle resources for peace of mind”. This session reveals 9 battle-tested Kubernetes-native strategies that took us from 9% to 50% utilization while IMPROVING reliability. The same directors who predicted “catastrophic failure” now champion optimization\, panic-paging our team if costs regress. Discover practical implementations and pitfalls\, such as tuning workload limits\, too many pods on nodes\, API server pressure\, reliable spot nodes\, etc. You can selectively adopt and combine these strategies to build your own multi-dimensional cost optimization blueprint\, precisely tailored to address the distinct challenges of your platform. Every technique uses open-source CNCF tools\, because the most expensive infrastructure isn’t compute - it's fear.

SUMMARY:Getting up To Date With Docsy: The Kubernetes Docs Upgrade in Progress - Natali Vlatko\, Cisco; Rey Lejano\, Red Hat; Divya Mohan\, SUSE; Sayak Mukhopadhyay\, Gemini Solutions
DESCRIPTION:With 12 million users of the Kubernetes documentation a year\, the maintenance of our docs is key. Alongside tech docs principles\, Kubernetes utilizes Hugo and Docsy to deliver the best experience for contributors and users. SIG Docs is in the process of aligning with upstream Docsy\, doing the work needed to upgrade several versions and adopt the latest features. While a significant amount of groundwork has been laid for this upgrade\, preparation is only half the story. It’s tempting to overhaul everything at once\, but it's imperative to continue delivering docs while the upgrade is in process. During this session\, maintainers will cover why upgrading is worthwhile\, how we’ve approached the refactor\, and the challenges we’ve encountered as we push on.

SUMMARY:Navigating the Rapid Evolution of Large Model Inference: Where Does Kubernetes Fit? - Jiaxin Shan\, Bytedance; Yuan Tang\, Red Hat; Sergey Kanzhelev\, Google; Rita Zhang\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Large model inference is evolving rapidly: model or expert parallelism\, prefill/decode disaggregation\, multi-lora and kv cache offloading push the limits of traditional serving. As infrastructure teams\, we must decide — what belongs in Kubernetes core primitives vs engines vs ecosystem projects? In this session\, WG-Serving chairs and industry leaders will share real-world lessons on managing these blurry boundaries. We’ll discuss how to evaluate new patterns\, balance control vs observability\, and adapt infrastructure to stay ahead in this dynamic landscape. Attendees will gain practical frameworks to decide when to extend Kubernetes vs offload to runtimes\, and insights into top emerging demands from large-scale LLM workloads.

SUMMARY:Beyond the Dashboard: Modern Observability for Platform Engineering at Scale - Danielle Cook\, Independent; Whitney Lee\, Datadog; Stevie Caldwell\, Fairwinds; Khallai Taylor\, E.ON Digital Technology GmbH; Payal Bagga\, Intuit
DESCRIPTION:Observability is everywhere\, but understanding where to focus can be overwhelming. As platform teams build internal developer platforms and self-service capabilities\, observability must evolve from a sea of dashboards to something far more strategic: actionable insights that support performance\, reliability\, and developer productivity.\nThis panel brings together a lineup of observability and platform engineering leaders—to share candid stories and hard-won lessons from end-user organizations like E.ON and Intuit. Together\, they’ll break down the many layers of observability from telemetry pipelines and OpenTelemetry adoption to aligning SLOs with business goals and embedding observability directly into developer workflows.\nWe’ll also explore how teams are leveraging AI to reduce MTTR and turn noisy signals into clear\, actionable intelligence\, all while keeping costs in check. This conversation will offer guidance and help you rethink what “good observability” really looks like.

SUMMARY:UX Research Report: Prometheus and OTel's Resource Attributes. - Victoria Nduka\, Independent & Amy Super\, Grafana Labs
DESCRIPTION:Prometheus and OpenTelemetry are two CNCF projects that focus on observability and truly excel at their main purposes. However\, it's no secret that they started their integration journey on the wrong foot. This story is getting better over time and being done in a data-driven way! Through CNCF's LFX mentorship program\, Victoria and Amy conducted UX Research to understand how Prometheus should handle OTel's Resource attributes. Using quantitative and qualitative approaches\, they collected opinions from co-founders of both projects\, active and old maintainers\, and several end-users. By joining this talk\, the audience will learn more about what is going well and what could be improved\, while listening to Victoria and Amy's educated suggestions for the project maintainers.

SUMMARY:Anti Patterns for Platform Teams (number 3 Will Surprise You!) - David Stenglein\, Missing Mass\, LLC
DESCRIPTION:As platform engineering has experienced a surge in interest and popularity\, some anti-patterns have started to emerge. If not dealt with these situations can fester and unravel the benefits of internal platforms. Recognize any of these situations? - The dumping ground: Hey\, you do ops\, right? Here\, take over my app. - Fixing the world: We're being crushed under an inverted testing pyramid but we want the platform to fix our problems. - The kitchen sink: Hey\, this new XYZ thing (probably AI) would make a great re-usable service! Scenarios like these are best dealt with by avoiding them altogether and we'll go over recognition and prevention. If you've already found yourself in the hole\, we'll also talk about some things you can do to dig your way out.

SUMMARY:Harmonizing Your Platform Domain With Kubernetes and Custom Resource Definitions - Sebastien Blanc\, Port
DESCRIPTION:As organizations adopt cloud-native technologies\, they often find themselves managing multiple platforms\, including internal developer platforms and SaaS providers. This fragmentation creates challenges for developers and SREs\, who must navigate disparate systems and tools to perform routine tasks.\n\nThis talk explores how to harmonize your platform domain by leveraging Kubernetes and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). CRDs allow you to extend the Kubernetes API to define and manage custom objects\, representing your specific platform domain concepts.\n\nWe'll discuss the benefits of this approach\, including streamlined developer workflows and increased platform adoption. We'll also address potential challenges\, such as API exposure and operator sprawl\, and offer strategies for overcoming them. By the end of this talk\, you'll have a clear understanding of how to leverage Kubernetes and CRDs to create a cohesive and harmonious platform domain.

SUMMARY:Managing Netflix’s Compute Infrastructure With Kubernetes and Dynamic Capacity Management - Charles Zheng & Nick Parker\, Netflix
DESCRIPTION:Netflix runs large\, multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters that power the company's compute infrastructure across streaming services and batch workloads. In this talk\, we share lessons from managing these fleets while building a resilient and cost-efficient capacity management system at cloud scale. We explain how a federated cellular structure to share resources across teams\, how we treat latency-sensitive services and throughput-heavy batch jobs\, and how we organize hardware into managed pools of nodes across a variety of users. We cover our soft capacity reservations that monitor real-time demand with shared buffers to support traffic spikes\, our extended disruption budgets that use health signals to limit service impact\, and our automated scaling\, and predictive resizing that reduce cost. Finally\, we show how unused capacity is filled with preemptible\, low-priority workloads to reduce waste. Throughout all of this we will discuss what has and hasn't worked along the way.

SUMMARY:Red Vs. Blue: A Live Attacker-Defender Showdown in Kubernetes Security - Lucy Sweet\, Uber & Sandeep Kanabar\, Gen
DESCRIPTION:What if learning Kubernetes security could be thrilling\, practical - and a little chaotic? In this interactive session\, we stage a live attacker-versus-defender "chess match" inside a Kubernetes cluster. One speaker plays the role of a determined attacker\, exploiting common misconfigurations\, privilege escalations\, and overly permissive RBAC. The other\, a vigilant defender\, responds with best-practice mitigations and live troubleshooting. You'll watch a Kubernetes environment come under siege - and see how thoughtful\, layered defenses can stop even persistent attackers in their tracks. Expect live demos\, sharp insights\, and just enough chaos to keep it real. We'll cover escalating security scenarios\, from pod privilege abuse to namespace isolation\, resource quotas and Admission Webhooks\, showing not just what to do\, but why it matters. This isn't theory-it's security by example\, performed live.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: HolmesGPT: Agentic K8s troubleshooting in your terminal
DESCRIPTION:Troubleshooting Kubernetes shouldn’t require hopping across dashboards\, logs\, and docs. With open-source tools like HolmesGPT and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server\, you can now bring an agentic experience directly into your CLI. In this demo\, we’ll show how this OSS stack can run everywhere\, from lightweight kind clusters on your laptop to production-grade clusters at scale. The experience supports any LLM provider: in-cluster\, local\, or cloud\, ensuring data never leaves your environment and costs remain predictable. We will showcase how users can ask natural-language questions (e.g.\, “why is my pod Pending?”) and get grounded reasoning\, targeted diagnostics\, and safe\, human-in-the-loop remediation steps -- all without leaving the terminal. Whether you’re experimenting locally or running mission-critical workloads\, you’ll walk away knowing how to extend these OSS components to build your own agentic workflows in Kubernetes.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: Coding Agents Are The Only Agent Framework You Need
DESCRIPTION:Do you really need a custom framework to build AI agents? Many teams invest in bespoke planning loops\, tool registries\, and orchestration layers. You may already have everything you need.\n\nCoding agents like Claude Code\, Cursor\, and Codex were designed to write software\, but code itself is the universal language of infrastructure. This talk shows how we built an agent harness around Claude Code to go beyond coding tasks into SRE workflows\, security operations\, and infrastructure management.\n\nWe’ll cover:\n\n* Why coding agents double as powerful sysadmins and operators\n* The architecture of our production-ready agent harness\n* Examples of applications from on-call to incident response\n* A live demo of Heroku Garden\, our “vibe-coding” interface powered by this system\n\nLearn how to leverage existing coding agents instead of reinventing frameworks and see a production agent in action.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Multi-Cluster Wars: The Scheduler Awakens - Dejan Pejchev & Priyanka Ravi\, G-Research
DESCRIPTION:AI/ML pipelines generate millions of diverse\, resource-hungry batch jobs—GPU bursts for training or CPU and memory-intensive preprocessing—that push single-cluster schedulers beyond ETCD scalability limits and single-region failure domains.\n\nMulti-cluster batch schedulers federate Kubernetes clusters to dynamically extend capacity across on-prem and cloud environments\, isolate tenants\, and survive zone outages.\n\nIn a multi-cluster context\, preemption must be coordinated globally to reclaim capacity where it’s most needed without starving distant workloads. Fair-share depends on quota enforcement so every team gets its entitled slice of compute. Gang scheduling reserves resources across clusters and only releases them when all parts of a multi-node job are ready to launch simultaneously.\n\nThis deep dive will explore how multi-cluster schedulers implement core batch scheduling features across federated Kubernetes clusters and their architectures.

SUMMARY:Community Capital: Making OSS and Businesses Successful Together - Liz Rice\, Isovalent at Cisco
DESCRIPTION:Just as open source success is about more than great code\, building a successful business on OSS relies on more than pricing. This talk explores how ecosystems thrive when maintainers\, vendors\, and users build on shared values and trust. We'll unpack why timing matters when open sourcing a project or contributing it to a foundation\, how vendors can grow real businesses by adding value around open source rather than trying to control it\, and why vendor success matters to the projects themselves. Drawing on Liz’s experience with the Cilium project and as former Chair of the TOC\, she’ll look at examples from the CNCF and beyond\, to show how shared values can lead to collective success\, and draw out the relationships between project health and vendor viability. Expect thoughtful metaphors\, practical takeaways\, and a reminder that open source isn’t a zero-sum game\, and commercial success can amplify community impact.

SUMMARY:Intelligent LLM Routing: A New Paradigm for Multi-Model AI Orchestration in Kubernetes - Chen Wang\, IBM Research & Huamin Chen\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:This research-driven talk introduces a novel architecture paradigm that complements recent advances in timely intelligent inference routing for large language models. By integrating proxy-based classification and reranking techniques\, we've developed a system that efficiently routes incoming prompts to domain-specialized LLMs based on rapid content analysis. Our approach creates a meta-layer of intelligence above traditional model serving infrastructures\, enabling specialized models to handle queries they're optimized for while maintaining a unified API interface. We'll present performance research comparing this distributed approach against monolithic inference-time scaling\, demonstrating how intelligent routing can achieve superior results for complex\, multi-domain workloads while reducing computational overhead. The session includes a Kubernetes-based reference implementation and quantitative analysis of throughput\, latency\, and accuracy across diverse prompt categories.

SUMMARY:Building Scalable End-to-end Latency Metrics From Distributed Trace - Kusha Maharshi\, Bloomberg
DESCRIPTION:This talk shares how Bloomberg used distributed tracing\, an OpenTelemetry standard\, to address a prevalent need: timing requests from point A to point Z in a cloud native system where a whole alphabet's worth of steps occur in between. This real-time solution ingests more than 50 billion daily spans\, modeled as streaming directed acyclic graphs with deep fan-outs and fan-ins. These fan-ins create scalability chokepoints but represent real-world scenarios like queuing systems for high-volume messaging\, order processing or batched notifications. This session will highlight the scalability challenges and lessons from building the architecture of an Apache Kafka and Kubernetes-based observability solution that turns complex trace data into actionable insight. The resulting end-to-end latency metrics power SLOs\, alerts\, and root-cause analysis. If you're into building low-latency\, high-throughput telemetry systems\, applying trace at scale\, or just geeking over graphs\, this talk is for you!

SUMMARY:Where’s My Pod? End-to-End Tracing for Kubernetes With OpenTelemetry - Artem Tkachuk & JP Phillips\, Netflix
DESCRIPTION:A Kubernetes developer opens the dashboard to check on a critical deployment\, only to find the pod is stuck in "Pending". What happened? Where’s the bottleneck? In the journey to modernize its compute infrastructure\, the Compute team at Netflix faced these same mysteries while migrating from a custom stack to open-source Kubernetes + containerd + CRI. To answer the perennial question\, “What happened to my Pod?”\, the Compute team built an end-to-end observability solution using OpenTelemetry tracing across the pod lifecycle. This talk demonstrates how connecting Netflix’s custom scheduler\, kubelet’s syncPod\, and container runtime traces enabled the team to visualize hidden delays\, such as global locks being the bottleneck for launching pods at scale and container registry issues affecting container launch times. The session offers a practical\, story-driven exploration of transforming pod observability—so you can finally answer your own “what happened?” with confidence.

SUMMARY:Capabilities\, APIs\, and Experiences: Blueprints To Build Interoperable Platforms - Marcos Lilljedahl\, Dagger & Mauricio "Salaboy" Salatino\, Diagrid
DESCRIPTION:Over the last 10 years\, Kubernetes has changed and unified the underlying APIs to define and run our cloud native ecosystems. But Kubernetes is just the start\, as the vibrant ecosystem of tools designed to add capabilities on top of your clusters is far from being unified and interoperable. This has the unintended consequence of introducing rigidity into your organization’s platform\, which manifests as reduced iteration speed and prolonged timeframes to adopt new technologies.\n\nIn this presentation\, Marcos and Mauricio will showcase existing blueprints that combine different projects to build platforms. They will then cover three aspects (platform capabilities\, platform APIs\, and experiences) that can help cloud-native projects deliver consistent experiences for platform teams\, mixing and matching tools to add capabilities to their platforms. This presentation not only focuses on the end-user platforms but also on how we can all contribute to driving consistency in the ecosystem.

SUMMARY:No Chicken Left Behind: Reliability and Observability With Service Mesh at Chick-Fil-A - Christopher Lane\, Chick-fil-A
DESCRIPTION:In late 2024\, Chick-fil-A's Cloud Platform Engineering team set out to simplify and secure how applications communicate across our Kubernetes environments. Our digital platforms needed better visibility\, consistent traffic policies\, and stronger governance\, without slowing down developer productivity. This talk walks through how we introduced a service mesh into our complex multi-cluster environment\, the technical and organizational challenges we encountered\, and the measurable impact it had. We'll share how we approached adoption incrementally\, validated the architecture\, and scaled up to handle production traffic — including critical workloads. We also capitalized on opportunities for cost savings\, improved security posture\, and faster incident response. Whether you're evaluating service meshes like Istio\, planning production rollouts\, or managing a mesh at scale\, this session offers practical takeaways on what worked\, what didn't\, and what we'd do differently.

SUMMARY:Node Manager - How Yahoo Manages Thousands of Nodes at Scale? - Payal Patel\, Yahoo
DESCRIPTION:Yahoo has been an early adopter of Kubernetes\, operating 37 on-premises K8s clusters that host 2\,700 applications across more than 8\,000 physical nodes. The daily management of these clusters & their physical nodes presents significant challenges\, including the process of upgrading the K8s version\, applying security updates\, upgrading the OS version of nodes\, and addressing node failures & safely removing faulty nodes from rotation to prevent impact on application pods. Yahoo developed the Node Manager operator\, which helps the execution of maintenance tasks\, performs controlled K8s version upgrades for control plane & worker nodes\, ensuring no impact to currently running applications & performs continuous health checks on nodes as configured per nodegroup & auto remediates nodes in the event of any issues. This talk will discuss how Yahoo manages these operations at scale through automation\, reducing manual work for engineers & improving efficiency in their infrastructure management.

SUMMARY:Optimizing Multi-Agent LLM Workloads With AMD GPUs and Kueue - Yuchen Fama\, Independent & Jodie Su\, AMD
DESCRIPTION:LLM inference workloads present distinct compute-memory phase transitions. Prompt ingestion involves compute-bound attention calculations\, whereas token generation becomes memory-bound due to repeated parameter loading from DRAM and HBM. Multi-agent systems integrate heterogeneous components with disparate resource demands that must operate synchronously. This session showcases how AMD GPUs and Kueue optimize compute and memory partitioning\, binpacking\, and colocation of tightly coupled agentic workflows alongside inference tasks with bursty resource patterns. Attendees will learn strategies to design advanced scheduling and binpacking for agent interaction workflows to achieve 50-70% higher throughput compared to traditional approaches. We'll demonstrate how high-capacity\, high-bandwidth GPUs such as AMD MI355x are optimized for mixed-workload AI applications and leveraging unified memory access to minimize cross-component latency while preserving isolation.

SUMMARY:The Future of Debugging Is No Debugging: Observability Is Dead - Jeremy Adams\, Neo4j
DESCRIPTION:Modern observability stacks are complex\, powerful\, and… sometimes\, overkill. As engineers\, we’ve grown obsessed with tracing every request\, logging every event\, and instrumenting every line of code. But is that really making debugging easier? Or are we just drowning in data that we rarely use effectively?\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll challenge the dominant narrative that better observability equals better debugging. Drawing from my experiences with Dagger\, I’ll argue that debugging itself is a symptom of reactive thinking—chasing down problems after they’ve already happened. Instead\, we should shift our focus to proactive design:\n\nImmutable pipelines where container states are frozen and reproducible\, reducing variabilityEphemeral\, disposable environments that cleanly reset after every runAutomated rollback and self-healing mechanisms that correct errors before they escalateAI agents that adapt workflows dynamically to avoid known failure patterns

SUMMARY:Extending Kubernetes API: The Hidden Power of Aggregated Server Objects - Amir Malka\, ARMO
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are the de facto method for extending the Kubernetes API. While powerful and flexible\, CRDs rely on etcd for storage\, making them suboptimal for managing larger objects such as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) or other high-volume datasets since they create a high load on etcd.\nThis talk re-introduces API server aggregation as an alternative extension mechanism for those who need to become more familiar with it. By leveraging this lesser-known Kubernetes feature\, projects like Kubescape have successfully managed oversized objects efficiently without burdening etcd.\nIn this session we will dive into the technical architecture\, use cases\, and the real-world benefits of using this technology via the use-case example of Kubescape.

SUMMARY:The Next Decoupling: From Monolithic Cluster\, To Control-Plane With Nodes - Justin Santa Barbara\, Google & Ciprian Hacman\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Historically a kubernetes cluster is both a control-plane and worker nodes\; management tools create and manage both. This model is simple to understand and effective\, but accidentally introduces operational friction\, particularly around upgrades\, scalability\, and cloud portability. The community has tackled many of those issues with projects such as cluster-api and karpenter\, moving node management to the extensible kubernetes control plane. In this session\, the kOps maintainers will explore this paradigm. We propose a clear division of responsibility where tools like kOps focus on their core strength - bootstrapping a robust\, production-grade control plane - and then cede node lifecycle management to common in-cluster\, kubernetes-API-driven tools like cluster-api and karpenter. We'll show how this addresses past challenges by abstracting node management behind the Kubernetes API itself\, creating a powerful “unified but interchangeable” story for "cluster" management tooling.

SUMMARY:Debugging Your Cluster When It’s on Fire - Nikola Grcevski\, Grafana Labs & Tyler Yahn\, Splunk
DESCRIPTION:Imagine you have a Kubernetes cluster that’s hosting some number of services\, perhaps these services are written in different programming languages\, perhaps there are some databases in the cluster too. Now\, imagine that this cluster is intermittently experiencing errors and it’s not easy to tell what’s going on. In this talk we will show you how you can add detailed telemetry immediately to a problematic production environment cluster\, without any changes to your existing cluster configuration or applications\, with the new OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation project. We’ll show you how you’ll be able to get insights into what’s wrong with your cluster or services\, by leveraging on-demand distributed traces and connectivity graphs\, even if it’s the first time you have heard the term OpenTelemetry. We’ll discuss the design principles which make this technology safe to deploy in an already problematic environment\, without further compromising the stability of your cluster.

SUMMARY:Zero-Downtime Telemetry: Hot Reloading OpenTelemetry Collector Pipelines - Amir Jakoby\, Sawmills & Shiran Melamed\, JFrog
DESCRIPTION:Cloud-native systems demand real-time adaptability—yet updating OpenTelemetry Collector processors often means restarts\, risking data loss and breaking observability. In this talk\, we introduce a powerful hot reload mechanism for dynamic reconfiguration of processors like filters\, samplers\, and transformers—without ever restarting the collector. Attendees will learn how to architect hot-swappable processors that respond instantly to pipeline changes\, enabling seamless updates\, uninterrupted data flow\, and zero downtime. Whether you're managing complex telemetry at scale or just tired of fragile restarts\, this session delivers the blueprint for a more resilient\, continuously observable stack.

SUMMARY:Component Contributor Architecture: Democratizing Platform Engineering With CNCF Projects - Anoop Gopalakrishnan & Jerome Guionnet\, Guidewire
DESCRIPTION:At Guidewire\, we needed a Kubernetes platform that reliably runs mission-critical insurance workloads while empowering teams to innovate rapidly. We developed the Component Contributor Model\, combining Crossplane’s resource abstraction with KubeVela’s Open Application Model into a modular\, extensible architecture. Application teams can now build and integrate platform components directly\, eliminating centralized bottlenecks. We standardized a component lifecycle to scale across diverse cloud services. Explicit trust boundaries preserve security while granting developer autonomy. A governance layer balances speed with stability. In this session\, you’ll discover how we configured a contributor-driven\, secure platform\; managed component lifecycles at scale\; and applied practical governance frameworks. You’ll gain actionable patterns for leveraging Crossplane and KubeVela in production\, plus strategies to evolve your platform as organizational demands grow.

SUMMARY:Designing Platforms With Judgment: Agentic Flows With MCP - Shivay Lamba\, Couchbase & Ekansh Gupta\, SigNoz
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a GitOps operator that doesn’t just blindly apply manifests but understands cost constraints\, incident context\, and security posture before acting.\n\nPlatform engineering today isn’t just about scaling infrastructure\, it’s about building intelligent systems that can interpret developer intent\, adapt to change\, and make responsible decisions autonomously.\n\nIn this session\, we introduce a new architectural pattern: agentic platforms. These platforms embed situational awareness into the delivery pipeline\, transforming ops from reactive to responsive. By incorporating policy\, workload\, and environment signals\, they enable secure-by-default provisioning\, context-aware automation\, and smart failure recovery.\n\nWe’ll explore how the Model Context Protocol (Kagent) supports this\, offering a flexible way to inject context into every automation path. Through real-world scenarios\, you’ll see how MCP-powered agentic flows help platforms say no when needed\, manage uncertainty gracefully.

SUMMARY:Not Forking Around: Leveraging NRI To Extend Kubernetes at Scale - Johan Jensen & Wesley Bermbach\, Uber
DESCRIPTION:Transitioning a fleet to Kubernetes is challenging\, even in the simplest environments. But what happens when hard business requirements demand features that Kubernetes doesn’t support yet? At Uber\, we faced this challenge as we migrated over 200\,000 database workloads from our proprietary infrastructure to Kubernetes. In this talk\, we’ll share how we used the Node Resource Interface (NRI) as a powerful interface to extend Kubernetes with custom features critical to our business\, without forking the core. NRI enabled us to meet our immediate needs while providing a clear path to deprecate it once upstream Kubernetes has the features we need. We’ll walk through our migration strategy\, the missing features that drove our use of NRI\, and how we successfully completed the transition. Finally\, we’ll outline our plans to phase out NRI\, adopt a fully vanilla Kubernetes stack\, and share key lessons others can take from our journey.

SUMMARY:Safely Sourcing OSS - Beyond 0 CVEs - John Kjell\, ControlPlane
DESCRIPTION:As container images shrink and teams chase the elusive “0 CVE” scan\, a host of other threats lurk beneath the surface of open source software. Security is more than vulnerabilities\; it’s about trust\, transparency\, and maintainability. Open source can be: - Improperly governed -- at risk of hostile takeovers - Maliciously licensed -- hiding legal landmines - End-of-life -- abandoned with no path forward - Poorly documented -- where “read the code” is the only option - Untested -- bugs waiting to detonate at scale - Insecurely released -- exposing the supply chain These non-obvious risks often paralyze teams trying to make informed choices. But a new generation of tools is emerging to bring clarity. We’ll explore how CNCF projects and Linux Foundation initiatives are using OpenSSF’s Security Scorecards\, SLSA\, Security Baseline\, and the 2025 updated TAG Security guidance on supply chain security to surface and share critical metadata that empowers safer open source adoption.

SUMMARY:📚 Tutorial: Unlock the Future of Kubernetes and Accelerators With Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) - Rey Lejano\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:At the heart of the AI revolution are GPUs and the platform that provides access to them is Kubernetes. Workloads historically access GPUs and other devices with the device plugin API but features are lacking. The new Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature helps maximize GPU utilization across workloads with additional features like the ability to control device sharing across Pods\, use multiple GPU models per node\, handle dynamic allocation of multi-instance GPU (MIG) and more. DRA is not limited to GPUs but any specialized hardware that a Pod may use including network attached resources such as edge devices like IP cameras. DRA is a new way to request for resources like GPUs and gives the ability to precisely control how resources are shared between Pods. This tutorial introduces DRA\, reviews the “behind-the-scenes” of DRA in the Kubernetes cluster and walks through multiple ways to use DRA to request for GPU and a network attached resource.

SUMMARY:Partitionable Devices: Putting the “Dynamic” Back in Dynamic Resource Allocation - Morten Jæger Torkildsen\, Google & Jan-Philip Gehrcke\, NVIDIA
DESCRIPTION:Not all workloads need giant GPUs. Think about inference - smaller models could use smaller GPUs. NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPUs (MIGs) are meant to solve this problem\, but using them in Kubernetes has been a big hassle requiring static pre-provisioning of these partitions\, or use of specialized CRDs and tooling.\n\nImagine if you could just ask for how much memory your model needs\, and Kubernetes would dynamically provision a partition just big enough to fit it! Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) can make that happen!\n\nCome learn how the latest version of DRA implements simple\, on-demand provisioning of MIGs based on the resource needs of your workload. You’ll also learn about how that same feature enables similar use cases with other accelerator technologies like Google’s TPU.\n\nDiscover how to optimize GPU utilization and see it in action with a demo!

SUMMARY:TikTok's IPv6 Journey To Cilium: Pitfalls and Lessons Learned - Giri Kuncoro & Joseph Pallamidessi\, TikTok
DESCRIPTION:Cilium has been the standard for Kubernetes networking and security. TikTok migrated clusters to use Cilium for its advanced security features like mutual authentication\, along with high performance networking and enhanced observability. The main challenge was executing this on TikTok IPv6 only datacenters\, as Cilium has been battle tested with IPv4 and dual-stack\, but not with IPv6 only environments.\n\nThis talk shares the journey of making Cilium work for IPv6 only Kubernetes\, highlighting the limitations and techniques to overcome them. First\, Cilium doesn't support tunneling over IPv6\, native routing mode must be configured. Second\, we encountered several bugs related to IPv6 only: NDP traffic getting dropped by Cilium Network Policy due to incorrect identification\; DNS policy not allowing traffic for IPv6 DNS servers\; broken cilium debug tools when IPv4 related BPF maps not found. Finally\, the NodePort timeout issue was blocking us from enabling Cilium to fully replace kube-proxy.

SUMMARY:Designing for Observability: From Noise To Insight - Andrea Chomiak\, Dash0
DESCRIPTION:Engineers often face cognitive overload\, noisy dashboards\, and alert fatigue\, especially when working with complex tools like OpenTelemetry. These challenges aren’t just technical\; they’re usability failures that impact incident response and developer experience. Yet the success of observability platforms often hinges on something less visible: design. Behind every intuitive dashboard and frictionless workflow is a designer translating complexity into clarity. This session offers a behind-the-scenes look from a product designer working in observability. Drawing on real-world experience designing for Kubernetes-native platforms built on OpenTelemetry\, the speaker shares how design decisions shape engineers’ ability to understand\, trust\, and act on telemetry data\, especially during high-pressure incidents. Takeaways: Why design is critical to observability and DevEx\, plus actionable strategies for visualizing complex telemetry.

SUMMARY:OpenTelemetry Logs Driving a Major Shift: Events\, Richer Data\, and Smarter Semantics - Robert Pająk\, Splunk
DESCRIPTION:OpenTelemetry Logs are no longer the least mature signal. They’re driving major changes across the project. This talk explores how recent developments\, including the introduction of OpenTelemetry Events\, richer semantic conventions\, and support for complex attribute values like nested objects and arrays. These changes are not isolated. They represent a coordinated effort to unify and modernize telemetry data\, improve correlation across signals\, and enable richer\, more structured observability experiences. This session will dive into the technical challenges\, design decisions\, and emerging patterns that are turning logs into a first-class citizen in the OpenTelemetry ecosystem. This session makes the case that logs are no longer “legacy”—they’re a foundation for smarter\, more unified observability. Whether you're a platform engineer\, SRE\, or tooling vendor\, understanding this shift is key to staying ahead as OpenTelemetry evolves.

SUMMARY:On the Origin of Platforms: Evolution of a Capital One Enterprise Platform - Bradley Whitfield & Jacob Walden\, Capital One
DESCRIPTION:In 2017\, our team set out to build a Kubernetes developer platform for microservices at Capital One. This talk explores our platform evolution\, from a proof-of-concept serving one team to a robust platform serving the enterprise. Attendees will learn how we leveraged the operator pattern to incorporate Capital One architectural patterns into the Kubernetes API. We’ll also explore how building trust and partnerships is a critical\, yet often overlooked\, aspect of platform engineering. Expanding on the operator pattern\, our platform evolved its capabilities into managing cloud resources outside the cluster with Kubernetes controllers and a managed Kubernetes offering to deploy off-the-shelf applications. Join us to hear more about the obstacles we overcame\, practical lessons learned\, and what we are exploring next as the platform continues its evolution.

SUMMARY:Securing AI Agent Infrastructure: AuthN/AuthZ Patterns for MCP and A2A - Yoshiyuki Tabata\, Hitachi\, Ltd.
DESCRIPTION:Is your AI agent infrastructure secure? As AI agents begin to exchange model context and coordinate across systems\, secure interaction is no longer optional—it’s essential. To bring structure to these interactions\, protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) have emerged\, offering standardized ways for agents to communicate. Adopting these protocols introduces new responsibilities. Developers must implement authentication and authorization (AuthN/AuthZ) mechanisms that comply with MCP and A2A while remaining practical for real-world deployment. In this session\, Yoshiyuki Tabata shares best practices for designing AuthN/AuthZ and shows how to apply key principles from the CNCF IAM whitepaper to AI agent infrastructure—such as OAuth-based API access\, P*P architecture for authorization\, and workload authentication. The session includes a demo of secure AuthZ for an MCP server using Keycloak\, illustrating how these practices apply in real-world agent interactions.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Confidential Observability on Kubernetes: Protecting Telemetry End-to-End - Jitendra Singh\, IBM India Pvt. Ltd.
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes observability tools\, like Fluent Bit\, OpenTelemetry\, and Loki\, provide deep visibility\, but they also handle sensitive data: user identifiers\, tokens\, and internal service metadata. Even with encryption at rest and in transit\, telemetry data is often exposed during collection and processing.\n\nIn this lightning talk\, we’ll show how to secure observability pipelines on Kubernetes using confidential computing-enabled nodes. We demonstrate how observability components (e.g.\, Fluent Bit\, OpenTelemetry Collector\, Loki) can run inside hardware-isolated Kubernetes nodes\, ensuring that telemetry data is encrypted at the source and only processed by trusted\, attested workloads.\nAttendees will learn a practical\, zero-intrusion design that combines Kubernetes-native observability tools with confidential compute infrastructure to deliver end-to-end encrypted\, trusted observability\, ideal for regulated workloads in finance\, healthcare\, and government.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Graceful Controller Operations: Achieving Leader Election Without Restarts - Jeffrey Ying\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Leader election in kubernetes often carries a hidden cost: disruptive container restarts during lease transitions. This lightning talk will illuminate the critical caveat in current leader election mechanisms where the entire container is forcefully shutdown and restarted via an os.Exit call to facilitate a lease change. We will explore the challenges this poses\, including service disruption and the inability to perform graceful cleanup. This session will outline the work that's been put in to make the entire transition process graceful and the new best practices of using the leader election client library.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Young? First-Gen? Female? New? Here’s Why You Belong Here Too - Jennifer Weir\, Ford Motor Company
DESCRIPTION:“Community” is derived from communis\, meaning “shared by all”. You’re part of many communities—some by birth\, others by choice—and the ones you’re born into shape the communities you choose to join. Now introduce the complexity of underrepresentation and you may start to wonder if you belong there at all.\n\nOpen source is the most inclusive solution to technology’s greatest problems\, but did you know only 3% of the 2017 Open Source survey’s respondents were women? CNCF has the power to accept contributions based on merit and inspire community members (yes\, that’s you!) to build confidence to take a seat at the table and contribute—whether it’s the 1st time or 100th. If communities are “shared”\, but individuals belong to unique groups\, how can you build and support a diverse cloud native community?\n\nThis talk explores key research on underrepresentation in open source contributions\, highlights the value of diverse perspectives in business\, and explains why representation matters to you.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: How We Used Data Structures When Contributing To the Kubernetes Project - Arsh Sharma\, MetalBear
DESCRIPTION:There’s often a lot of debate in software engineering circles about the value of teaching data structures and algorithms to those just starting out. Honestly\, when I was beginning my journey\, I used to think of them as a complete waste of time too. This talk aims to challenge such notions by demonstrating how data structures can have real world applications in open source projects like Kubernetes.\n\nI’m one of the creators and maintainers of the `depstat` project\, which Kubernetes uses to evaluate dependency updates. In this talk\, I’ll share the design decisions we made while building this tool and how we leveraged data structures like graphs and graph traversal algorithms to implement it effectively.\n\nThis talk will provide attendees with an understanding of what the `depstat` project does and also leave them with a deeper appreciation for the application of foundational computer science concepts in the world of open source!

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Summarizing the Noise: LLM Observability With Open Data Hub\, VLLM\, KServe and Prometheus - Twinkll Sisodia\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:As large language models (LLMs) move into production\, raw metrics alone aren’t enough. This talk presents an open-source AI observability solution built on Open Data Hub (ODH) that deploys LLMs using vLLM and KServe\, scrapes inference metrics using Prometheus\, and feeds them into a summarization model to generate actionable insights. We’ll demonstrate a working UI that translates low-level metrics like latency\, GPU usage\, and token throughput into human-readable summaries—giving platform teams an intelligent way to monitor LLMs at scale. No dashboards to interpret—just straight answers from your models about your models.

SUMMARY:Drasi: A New Take on Change-driven Architectures - Aman Singh\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Modern cloud-native systems constantly generate data changes\, and applications often need to react to them. Building change-driven solutions that respond to specific changes in distributed data is challenging. This talk introduces Drasi\, a CNCF Sandbox project that simplifies the design and implementation of change-driven architectures by codifying continuous query and reaction patterns. For example\, with Drasi you can declaratively write automation to detect and respond to running containers with newly identified vulnerabilities across pods and deployments in a Kubernetes cluster. Join us for a walkthrough of real-world use cases and live demos that show how Drasi’s approach brings structure and responsiveness to complex distributed environments—without writing custom code.

SUMMARY:Diagnosing Application Performance With EBPF\, Pyroscope\, and Kubernetes - Liam Mackie\, Octopus Deploy
DESCRIPTION:In this case study\, we’ll share how our team guarantees that the software we ship - packaged as a Helm chart and running in customer clusters - is performant under any situation a customer can put it in. When traditional metrics fell short\, we turned to kernel-level eBPF profiling using Pixie and continuous profiling using Pyroscope. Along with OpenTelemetry tracing\, we were able to drill down into our implementation's hotspots. By deploying this tooling in our own clusters\, pushing our software to its limits\, and correlating the telemetry gathered\, we uncovered inefficient loops\, then rolled out fixes before our customers hit these problems themselves. Attendees will walk away with a framework of observability tooling to enable the analysis of applications running in-cluster\, and allow them to find and fix performance regressions faster than ever before!

SUMMARY:Observing Dark Matter With OpenTelemetry - Sam Alipio & Mario Macías\, Grafana Labs
DESCRIPTION:Stories of time wasted and (lots of emotions). What time do we really measure when we instrument our applications and try to collect request duration times? What conclusions do we draw when the request duration reported by client requests don’t even come close to the times reported by the server? Do we blame our network\, our reverse proxies or our monitoring tools when “dark matter” gaps exist in our traces? This talk covers some subtle nuances in request duration measurement\, which can often lead to completely misleading results. We dig deep into the OpenTelemetry instrumentation approaches in a few popular programming languages and correlate what the duration timings we see in our traces or logs mean. We'll show how using the newly donated OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation for application instrumentation allows us to augment our telemetry to overcome various inaccuracies in duration measurement... and get closer to the truth.

SUMMARY:Composable Platforms in the Wild: Patterns That Work (and Fail) - Daniel Bryant\, Syntasso
DESCRIPTION:Composable platforms are redefining how internal platform teams deliver value. While the theory is compelling\, the real-world results can be mixed. In this talk\, we’ll explore the patterns that actually work (and the ones that don’t) when building composable platforms using Kubernetes\, and tools like Backstage\, Crossplane\, and Kratix. Drawing from experience across regulated enterprises\, scaling startups\, and open source communities\, we’ll examine how teams are approaching modular service delivery\, integrating self-service with governance\, and balancing autonomy with consistency. You'll learn: - Which architectural and team patterns accelerate platform adoption - Why some “composability” efforts create more confusion than clarity with janky abstractions - How to identify early warning signs of failure\, such as bloated GitOps repos and overly rigid golden paths This talk is for platform engineers\, architects\, and leaders who want to make composable platforms deliver real outcomes.

SUMMARY:One Dozen To One Thousand Clusters: How Argo Kept up as We Scaled - Jérémy Albuixech & Kahou Lei\, Okta
DESCRIPTION:In 2020\, a team of engineers at Auth0 selected Argo Workflows and ArgoCD for their new private cloud platform because of the Kubernetes compatibility\, support for Kustomize\, and ability to speed up the initial implementation efforts. Since then\, the platform has scaled dramatically\, to nearly a thousand clusters\, 1M+ resources and hundreds of daily deploys. Argo has continued to prove its value\, adapting seamlessly to the platform’s rapid growth and evolving requirements. At KubeCon NA last year Kahou and Jeremy presented their red/black deployment strategy for zero-downtime daily updates across numerous clusters. This time they will focus on Argo\, a central component of their platform's architecture. Their presentation will cover the evolution of their Argo usage and the difficulties they faced. They will share the solutions they implemented\, the present status of their Argo deployments\, the existing limitations\, and their rationale for choosing Argo over alternative solutions.

SUMMARY:Why Is My Query Slow? Real AI Use Cases With Vitess + Kubernetes + Prometheus - Brett Warminski & Gourav Khanijoe\, Hubspot
DESCRIPTION:Self-service database platforms help teams move fast—but only if engineers can help themselves. Over the past two years\, the HubSpot data infrastructure team has built and evolved a suite of LLM-powered tools to assist developers working with their large Vitess installation running on Kubernetes. In this talk\, the team will share what worked (and what didn't): from interpreting slow query plans to guiding self-scaling decisions to failed attempts at RAG-based documentation search. Participants will learn about latency workarounds\, integrations with chat and UI flows\, prompt pitfalls\, and the essential glue work that made it all usable.

SUMMARY:Security Theater or Real Defense? Navigating Open Source Security in a Cloud Native World - Rotem Refael\, ARMO; Constanze Roedig\, Technical University of Vienna; Megan Wolf\, Defense Unicorns; Stefana Muller\, Salesforce; Oshrat Nir\, Independent
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes teams are drowning in dashboards\, buried in YAML\, and haunted by the ghost of “shift left.” Everyone says security is built-in\, but breaches still happen\, compliance still bites and engineers are still burned out. So what’s actually working… and what’s just performative security theater? This women-led panel cuts through the noise. Featuring OSS contributors\, DevSecOps veterans\, and security leads from production-grade\, cloud-native environments\, we’re here to talk honestly about what breaks\, what works\, and what’s pure illusion. They’re contributors and practitioners behind CNCF toolsets—and they’ve seen it all: what works\, what fails\, and what we wish we knew earlier. Explore what’s real vs. theater in Kubernetes security: how to measure impact\, where CNCF tools help (or fall short)\, and how to stay effective under pressure. No fluff\, no vendor pitches. Just battle-tested insights from engineers on the front lines of securing cloud-native infrastructure at scale.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Threat Modeling Kubernetes: Fast\, Practical\, and LLM-Driven - Maxime Coquerel\, Royal Bank of Canada
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes environments are inherently complex especially in regulated industries due to integrations with service meshes\, secrets management\, and policy engines. Traditional threat modeling often struggles to keep up with this dynamic ecosystem.\n\nIn this 5-minute session\, I’ll introduce a streamlined\, Kubernetes-specific threat modeling approach that integrates naturally into dev and SRE workflows. You’ll learn how to quickly identify risks across clusters\, workloads\, and third-party components.\n\nWe’ll also cover how large language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating threat scenarios\, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK\, and helping teams continuously refine their security posture.\nYou’ll leave with actionable tactics to embed threat modeling into your engineering practices fast\, repeatable\, and built for modern cloud-native environments.

SUMMARY:⚡ Lightning Talk: Tracing the Untraceable: OpenTelemetry for ‘Vibe-Coded’ LLM Apps - Pranay Prateek\, SigNoz
DESCRIPTION:Large-language-model–powered features feel like magic—until the magic misfires in production. Unlike the rest of our cloud-native stack\, LLM apps are non-deterministic: the same prompt can yield wildly different outputs depending on model state\, temperature\, etc. Traditional pre-prod tests catch only a fraction of these edge cases.\n\nIn this lightning talk\, I’ll demo a “vibe-coded” LLM application that looks fine in dev but hallucinates customer-visible issues once real traffic hits.\n\nI will then inject OpenTelemetry spans and semantic attributes (prompt\, temperature\, model version\, vector-DB latency\, user feedback) and stream them into an open source observability backend. Attendees can watch in real time as traces pinpoint where uncertainty mutates into failure—turning opaque AI behavior into measurable\, alertable signals.\n\nAttendees will leave with a template on how to make their application more observable and reliable using OpenTelemetry

SUMMARY:Keynote: Beyond Operations: Scaling Platform Engineering in the CNCF Community - Abby Bangser\, Principal Engineer\, Syntasso
DESCRIPTION:Cloud native has always been about more than technology. Each wave of innovation\, from early projects reshaping deployment to today’s higher-level platforms\, has combined technical progress with shifts in how organisations deliver value. Yet too often these movements narrow into tool-centric quick fixes.\nPlatform engineering sits at these crossroads. On one side it risks becoming another hype cycle\, but on the other it offers a way out of today’s fragmented\, unsustainable reality.\n\nThis keynote explores how decades of platform experience paired with the Linux Foundation and CNCF are guiding this evolution through community groups\, white papers\, and foundational technologies. It will challenge us to see platform engineering not as another operational trend\, but as a higher-level abstraction\, one that highlights organisational patterns\, tackles interoperability\, and informs architectural choices to ensure platforms deliver lasting value.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Keynote: Scaling Smarter: Simplifying Multicluster AI with KAITO and KubeFleet - Jorge Palma\, Principal PM Lead for Azure Kubernetes Services\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:As demand for AI workloads on Kubernetes grows\, multicluster inferencing has emerged as a powerful yet complex architectural pattern. While multicluster support offers benefits in terms of geographic redundancy\, data sovereignty\, and resource optimization\, it also introduces significant challenges around orchestration\, traffic routing\, cost control\, and operational overhead.\n\nTo address these challenges\, we’ll introduce two CNCF projects—KAITO and KubeFleet—that work together to simplify and optimize multicluster AI operations. KAITO provides a declarative framework for managing AI inference workflows with built-in support for model versioning\, and performance telemetry. KubeFleet complements this by enabling seamless workload distribution across clusters\, based on cost\, latency\, and availability. Together\, these tools reduce operational complexity\, improve cost efficiency\, and ensure consistent performance at scale.

SUMMARY:Keynote: Predictive Scaling and Capacity Planning With Machine Learning at Amazon.com - Artur Souza & Chunpeng Wang\, Amazon
DESCRIPTION:Most cloud native services scale horizontally by reacting to increased incoming traffic throughput\, CPU utilization or any other relevant metric. While this approach works most of the time\, the reaction time might not be fast enough for high velocity events\, resulting in many customer facing errors (like high latency and checkout failures)\, consequently\, impacting customer experience.\n\nIn this session\, Chunpeng and Artur will delve into how Prime Day\, Diwali\, Black Friday and many other high velocity events are handled to keep all services at Amazon.com available. You will learn how we use machine learning and record keeping of future events to proactively scale thousands of services running on top of AWS and then de-scale to keep running at forecasted loads for business-as-usual.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: KubeHound: Identifying attack paths in Kubernetes clusters at scale
DESCRIPTION:In this talk we will introduce how KubeHound\, an opinionated\, scalable\, offensive-minded Kubernetes attack graph tool used by security teams across Datadog\, can help you pinpoint the most critical attack within your Kubernetes cluster. Single point security findings have little traction either for an attacker or defender. So we will demonstrate how KubeHound being a queryable\, graph database of attack paths makes reasoning about security problems via data-driven testing of hypotheses extremely efficient. Live demos of KubeHound will be performed during the talk.\n\nAt the end of the talk\, we will leave you with an open-source tool designed to be run from a laptop to evaluate the attack paths within a single cluster from an attacker or defender point of view. Finally\, we will discuss the approach and challenges of implementing a distributed\, large-scale version of the tool at Datadog and how you might implement a similar solution in your own environment.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

SUMMARY:Building Cloud Native Agentic Workflows on Kubernetes for Preventative Healthcare - Benjamin Consolvo\, AMD & Daron Yöndem\, AWS
DESCRIPTION:Modern preventative-care programs need to reach thousands of patients without drowning clinicians in manual outreach. In this session we show how an open-source\, cloud-native stack (including Kubernetes\, APISIX\, and Prometheus)\, and the AutoGen multi-agent framework\, automates the entire loop: (1) defining U.S. Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria\, (2) filtering patient records\, and (3) generating personalized emails via OSS LLMs (Llama 3 & DeepSeek-R1) served behind an OpenAI-compatible API on K8s-native AI accelerators. We’ll dissect the YAML and Helm chart flows that keep model endpoints\, agents\, and the Streamlit front end deployed. Attendees will learn how to:\n• Build the model inference endpoint orchestration layers with K8s and Helm charts\;\n• Manage API traffic and authentication with APISIX (built on NGINX and etcd)\;\n• Stitch agents together with async Python\; and\n• Oversee monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana.

SUMMARY:High-Performance AI Workloads in KubeVirt VMs With NVIDIA GPUs: Challenges and Real-World Solutions - Ezra Silvera\, IBM & Michael Hrivnak\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Running AI/ML workloads in Pods on bare-metal is common for maximizing GPU performance but lacks strong isolation and flexibility. In this talk\, we share how we use KubeVirt to run high-performance AI workloads inside VMs with NVIDIA GPUs and NVLink\, achieving near bare-metal speeds. This enables multi-tenancy\, improved security\, and resource partitioning—critical for service providers and cost-efficient for customers. We’ll show how VM-based worker nodes enable virtual Kubernetes clusters on shared infrastructure\, supporting both full BM nodes and partitioned node use cases. We'll also dive into challenges like integrating NVIDIA Fabric Manager with the Kubebernets/KubeVirt workflow \, optimizing NUMA and PCI topology\, and aligning Kubernetes scheduling with VM-based GPU layouts. Finally\, we’ll share customer use cases demonstrating the need for isolated\, high-performance AI environments using Kubernetes-native tooling.

SUMMARY:Autoscaling Spring Boot Apps in Kubernetes With KEDA - John Coyne\, Capital One
DESCRIPTION:The Horizonal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes has limited functionality in offering container CPU or Memory as metrics to monitor pod scaling performance. However\, the CNCF Graduated Project KEDA\, short for Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling\, offers a wide array of options. One of these includes using metrics exposed by Prometheus\, another CNCF Graduated project. Another is Micrometer\, an Open Source metrics facade that integrates nicely with Spring Boot\, which can expose many different metrics from an application. Adding one additional dependency can help to expose those metrics in a format that is understood by Prometheus. Putting all of these together\, we can expose any metric we desire from our application and use that to drive the scaling of an application in Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:Spark on Kubernetes\, a Practical Guide - Damon Cortesi\, Airbnb
DESCRIPTION:If you're just getting started with Apache Spark on Kubernetes\, this talk is for you. Especially if you're moving on from Spark on YARN where most components are tightly integrated with Spark. Spark on Kubernetes sounds great in theory\, but as soon as you get started there are numerous decision to be made including how to submit your jobs (there are now 2 main operators)\, which shuffle service to use (again at least 2)\, which scheduler and queue management system to use (about 4 this time)\, and that doesn't even begin to touch how to optimize your storage and where to send logs. Join me on our journey through all of the above\, including how we benchmarked Spark on Kubernetes with existing systems using TPC-DS and simulating real-world workloads. This talk is your field guide for getting started with Spark on Kubernetes\, built from real-world experimentation and hard-earned lessons.

SUMMARY:Economics of Platforms: Building Marketplaces Beyond Golden Paths - Atulpriya Sharma\, InfraCloud Technologies
DESCRIPTION:You've built golden paths\, achieved adoption\, but now face the scaling bottleneck: every new capability requires your team to build\, maintain\, and support it. What if instead of being the sole provider\, you became the marketplace operator? This talk introduces the Internal Developer Marketplace model\, which transforms platforms from centralised services into economic ecosystems where any team contributes capabilities. We'll explore how organisations can evolve from paved paths to community-driven platforms where engineering capabilities become tradeable assets. Through practical examples\, we'll learn about contribution frameworks that turn domain expertise into platform capabilities\, governance models that maintain quality without gatekeeping\, and recognition systems that incentivise meaningful contributions. The result? Platform engineering that scales beyond your team's capacity\, leverages distributed expertise\, and creates sustainable growth through network effects.

SUMMARY:The Journey of Deploying Backstage in a Large Organization - Mathieu Girard & Teddy Poingt\, Beneva
DESCRIPTION:Being a developer in 2025 means a lot more than it used to. The cognitive load and the number of development related activities other than coding that needs to be taken into consideration keeps growing every day (CI/CD\, infra-as-code\, cloud\, finops\, networking\, monitoring\, containers\, security\, etc.) Internal developer portals are meant to help with this issue but can be challenging to deploy successfully in a large organization. At Beneva\, we’ve been running Backstage for almost three years now and our developers are grateful. In our talk\, we’ll deep dive in our journey\, from the very beginning of sponsorship and financing for our portal initiative to the deployment of Backstage itself and how the mindset of our development teams as portal users evolved from “one more thing they would have to care about” to considering it the one thing that could help them manage and deliver their solutions more efficiently.

SUMMARY:Sponsored Demo: No Silos\, One Data Plane: Fast & Secure SW-Defined Data Ops for Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes workloads demand diverse data services: block CSI for databases\, file CSI for analytics\, and native S3 for AI/ML pipelines. Today\, these are delivered through siloed backends with separate lifecycles\, quotas\, and policies. This session shows how to unify them into a single software-defined data plane using a centralized data intelligence platform.\n\nThe platform simultaneously presents block\, file\, and S3 into Kubernetes via one control plane\; supports multi-tenant policies and quotas\; and enforces QoS with rate-limiting and priority scheduling to prevent noisy-neighbor issues. As a software-defined solution\, it spans core\, cloud\, and hybrid models.\n\nIn the demo\, we will provision multi-tenant block/file/object storage\, set per-tenant quotas and QoS via APIs\, and show enforcement across AI training (file)\, inference (block)\, and RAG (S3). Attendees will see how a centralized platform simplifies Kubernetes data services\, ensuring predictable performance and streamlined operations.\n\n*In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event\, you may choose to visit a third party’s booth or access sponsored content.

DESCRIPTION:A long time ago (okay\, not that long)\, stateless microservices ruled the galaxy. But a new force is rising\, shaped by agents\, LLMs\, and highly dynamic\, resource-intensive workloads. As traffic shifts from simple REST to streaming tokens\, prompt orchestration and GPU-aware routing\, traditional gateways are showing their limits.\n\nWe’ll explore what it takes to build GenAI platforms capable of serving modern inference at scale without falling to the dark side of complexity. You’ll learn from a real-world reference architecture using open-source tools like Envoy AI Gateway\, KServe\, and others—designed to support dynamic model-based routing\, token-level rate limiting\, secure upstream auth\, observability\, and multi-provider failover. These aren’t bonus features–they’re the new minimum requirements for reliable AI inference.\n\nYou’ll leave with a practical blueprint for routing\, serving and observing LLM traffic\, and a clearer vision for how today’s CNCF tools are awakening in the GenAI era.

SUMMARY:Bringing OCI Into the GitOps World - Jesse Suen\, Akuity
DESCRIPTION:Git has long been the foundation of GitOps\, but what if deployment configs were treated like versioned software packages? This talk explores how the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format\, originally designed for container images\, is evolving to support a wide array of cloud-native artifacts\, including Helm charts\, WebAssembly (Wasm) modules\, Lambda functions\, and Kustomize configuration bundles. We’ll dive into how the OCI ecosystem is becoming a powerful\, interoperable standard not just for deployment runtimes but for the full lifecycle of cloud-native applications. We’ll examine how tools like Argo CD\, Flux\, and Kargo are embracing OCI registries as first-class citizens and the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting this approach. Attendees will learn: how OCI extends beyond containers\; how to package and distribute complex or binary artifacts\; and how OCI compares to Git in a GitOps context.

SUMMARY:Next Generation Extension Management Using Kubernetes Image Volumes - Andrew L'Ecuyer\, Crunchy Data Solutions
DESCRIPTION:A longstanding challenge within the Postgres ecosystem is the management of add-ons\, such as database extensions. With hundreds of extensions available\, a typical Postgres user will require at least one database extension. Yet challenges arise in immutable container environments where we want to minimize image bloat and build complexity. Thanks to the introduction of Image Volumes in Kubernetes\, however\, the conversation around extension management has shifted. More specifically\, Image Volumes provide a powerful new way of packaging and distributing extensions using your existing cloud-native infrastructure. In this talk\, you will see how Crunchy Data is using Image Volumes\, together with the latest Postgres features\, to enable a seamless extension management in Kubernetes. We'll walk through a real-world example using pgvector\, demonstrating how extensions can be built into OCI images\, distributed via an image registry\, and then mounted into database Pods for installation and use.

SUMMARY:Building a Kubernetes-native Experience for Your Multi-cluster Fleet - Andrea Tosatto & James Munnelly\, Apple
DESCRIPTION:Operating multiple Kubernetes clusters is becoming par for the course in any enterprise-scale Kubernetes deployment. As the complexity of your infrastructure deployments grow\, so do the opportunities for inefficiencies.\n\nOnce the boundaries of a single cluster have been broken\, the first place this complexity goes to is the end-user\, often the least-well-informed to make decisions about optimal resource placement across a global fleet.\n\nThis talk is a deep-dive into taming the user experience of multi-cluster scheduling in order to enable platform engineering teams to reclaim the power in placing workload across fleets of clusters\, and will cover:\n\n* Multi-cluster resource views (‘pod aggregation’) and subresource proxying for a seamless multi-cluster experience.\n* Multi-cluster discovery\, authentication and authorization patterns.\n* Using MultiKueue as the engine for multi-cluster quota abstractions.\n* Using the tenant as the scaling boundaries with scoped apiserver views.

SUMMARY:Evicted! All the Ways Kubernetes Kills Your Pods (and How To Avoid Them) - Ahmet Alp Balkan\, LinkedIn
DESCRIPTION:Anyone running Kubernetes in a large-scale production environment cares deeply about having a predictable Pod lifecycle. Having unknown actors in the system that can terminate your Pods is a scary thought — especially if you run stateful systems on Kubernetes. There are many paths in the Kubernetes core that can abruptly terminate your workloads and cause your apps to dip below their Pod Disruption Budgets\, risking unavailability for your customers. Documentation doesn’t go so far as to explain all these paths or how they work. In this talk\, we’ll focus on the lesser-known abrupt pod eviction modes caused by Kubernetes components — ranging from kubelet to scheduler to controller-manager — and do a deep dive into Kubernetes internals to explain exactly how these pod terminations happen and what guarantees you can expect. We’ll also debunk some myths like ‘kubelet restarts are safe’. At the end\, you’ll leave with a cheatsheet to help you reason about all eviction modes in Kubernetes.

SUMMARY:From Pull To Predict: Accelerating AI Model Deployment on Kubernetes - Lucas Duarte & Tiago Reichert\, AWS
DESCRIPTION:In the era of large AI models\, deployment latency and resource utilization present significant challenges for Kubernetes operators. This session demonstrates techniques to reduce model startup times and optimize cluster resources. We'll deploy a 7B parameter LLM using Ray and vLLM for scaling and serving\, implementing three key optimizations: SOCI (Seekable OCI) for lazy loading of container images\, enabling containers to start without downloading the entire image first\; an optimized storage layer that keeps models pre-downloaded and ready for quick access\; and intelligent node provisioning using Karpenter for dynamic resource allocation. We'll compare a standard deployment against one using these optimizations\, showing the differences in startup times\, resource usage\, and operational costs. Attendees will learn implementation steps for these techniques\, which they can apply to their own Kubernetes environments to improve AI model deployment efficiency.

SUMMARY:The Questions Not Asked: A Critical Retrospective on Platform Engineering - Shweta Vohra\, Booking.com; Ram Iyengar\, Cloud Foundry Foundation; Daniel Bryant\, Syntasso; Kunal Kushwaha\, Civo
DESCRIPTION:Everyone is doing platform engineering — yet something still feels off. Why? Rather than celebrate what we already know\, this session surfaces what we may be overlooking & the new thinking needed to move forward. We’ll unpack how the meaning of platform is evolving & challenge assumptions like developer experience above all\, platform as a product\, unclear ownership that stalls progress\, and golden paths that feel more like restrictions. These are the contradictions many teams face today. In this panel\, trusted platform thinkers from across the ecosystem come together to ask: Are we solving the right problems\, in the right way\, with the right teams or just reinforcing complexity & losing business context that platform engineering is meant to serve? We’ll revisit platform patterns that stood the test of time\, explore shifts in open source and orchestration\, and imagine what continuity and innovation should look like next. This isn’t a debate — it’s an industry check-in. A creative reset.

SUMMARY:Effortlessly Build High-Performance AI/ML Processing Pipelines Within the ML Lifecycles - Kazuki Yamamoto\, NTT
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an enlightening presentation on effortlessly building an advanced processing form called "processing pipeline "for AI/ML workloads. In streaming processing\, accelerators are assigned only to specific tasks in the workload. However\, we can build high-performance processing infrastructure at the service level by assigning each task to a suitable accelerator and chaining them together. Native Kubernetes is a popular choice for deploying AI/ML workloads. However\, more is needed to deploy a new processing form: the "processing pipeline" chaining accelerators. This presentation will demonstrate how effortlessly a video inference system can be built using the "processing pipeline"\, which leverages Numaflow and "Dynamic Resource Allocation" (DRA). It will also introduce the "processing pipeline "that can be integrated into MLOps through Kubeflow Pipelines. You will see a glimpse of future innovations\, including high-speed communication between accelerators via the 2nd NIC.

SUMMARY:Supercharge Cloud Native SQL Database With Object Storage: Scaling TiKV With S3 as the Backbone - Jinpeng Zhang\, PingCAP
DESCRIPTION:Object storage like Amazon S3 is known for its scalability\, durability\, and cost-efficiency—but can it serve as the foundation for high-performance transactional databases? In this talk\, I’ll share how TiKV\, the storage layer of the distributed SQL database TiDB\, was re-architected to use object storage as the source of truth. This shift unlocked massive scalability\, faster disaster recovery and backup restores\, and significantly lower storage costs—without sacrificing performance. I’ll dive into the key innovations that decouple compute and storage\, keeping object storage off the performance-critical path. Through smart caching\, tiered storage\, and optimized write paths\, we achieved single-digit millisecond p99 latency and millions of TPS at cloud scale. Join us to see how this approach redefines the storage stack for cloud-native databases—and what it means for the future.

SUMMARY:Fast and the Furious: CICD Pipeline for eBPF Programs at Meta Scale - Theophilus Benson & Prankur Gupta\, Meta
DESCRIPTION:At Meta\, we run over 150 eBPF programs on our machines which provide a range of custom functionality from network observability\, load balancing\, network stack specialization and security features. We update these eBPF programs at least once a week to cater to changes in our microservice stack which introduces opportunities for outages. While we maintain a custom and flexible in house CI/CD pipeline for ensuring high velocity of our microservices\, we observed that we were unable to use the same pipeline for our eBPF programs because of nuances of the eBPF ecosystem and the fact our eBPF programs run in the kernel. Over the last five years\, we have tailored our CI/CD pipeline to effectively support eBPF programs and their nuances. In this talk\, we describe challenges faced in tailoring our CI/CD pipeline\, highlight lessons learned from several production outages\, and discuss on-going work to further enhance our eBPF-centric CI/CD pipeline.

SUMMARY:GitOps Without Variables - Brian Grant & Alexis Richardson\, ConfigHub Inc.
DESCRIPTION:ClickOps vs GitOps? Why not both? Initiating every change with an update to Git means finding the right lines of files to change\, committing the fix\, and updating production. But when your application is broken\, speed matters. Do you have time to work out how to modify a 3000-line Helm chart and figure out which other teams\, workloads\, and clusters this will impact? Or you can ‘break glass’ and edit live production state\; but now you have created drift from desired state! We want to end your frustration - with a new approach. We will demonstrate an evolution of GitOps where you can query and operate on configuration in bulk\, use Kubernetes dashboards to fix runtime errors quickly\, and synchronize bidirectionally with your clusters. Our solution is to separate all config data from the code used to update it. We store config as fully rendered plain YAML resources (“Write Every Time”) and show how to update this live without using “DRY” templates\, variables\, inline conditionals or loops.

SUMMARY:Mission Abort: Intercepting Dangerous Deletes Before Helm Hits Apply - Payal Godhani\, Oracle
DESCRIPTION:What if your next Helm deployment silently deletes a LoadBalancer\, a Gateway\, or an entire namespace? We’ve lived that nightmare—multiple times. In this talk\, we’ll share how we turned painful Sev1 outages into a resilient\, guardrail-first deployment strategy. By integrating Helm Diff and Argo CD Diff\, we built a system that scans every deployment for destructive changes—like the removal of LoadBalancers\, KGateways\, Services\, PVCs\, or Namespaces—and blocks them unless explicitly approved. This second-layer approval acts as a safety circuit for your release pipelines. No guesswork. No blind deploys. Just real-time visibility into what’s about to break—before it actually does. Whether you’re managing a single cluster or an entire fleet\, this talk will show you how to stop fearing Helm and start trusting it again. Because resilience isn’t about avoiding failure—it’s about learning\, adapting\, and building guardrails that protect everyone.

SUMMARY:GitOps and the Manifest Dilemma: Helm\, Kustomize\, Crossplane\, Kro\, and Beyond - Dag Bjerre Andersen\, Egmont
DESCRIPTION:As Kubernetes adoption grows\, so does the need to manage manifests in a scalable and maintainable way. We used to rely mainly on Helm and Kustomize for templating\, but today the ecosystem is evolving rapidly - new manifest-generation tools appear regularly\, each with its own syntax\, execution model\, and design philosophy. This talk explores the fragmented landscape of manifest rendering tools and how well they align - or clash - with GitOps principles. We’ll examine the core differences between tools that render manifests outside the cluster (e.g.\, Helm\, Kustomize) and those that rely on in-cluster controllers and CRDs (e.g.\, Crossplane\, KubeVela\, Kro). These two paradigms differ not only technically\, but also in how they integrate with popular GitOps platforms like Argo CD and Flux. Through practical comparisons\, attendees will gain a clear understanding of the core paradigms behind these tools - their strengths\, limitations\, and how well they align with GitOps workflows.

SUMMARY:Transforming Kubernetes Clusters Into a Multi-Tenant Powerhouse at Electronic Arts - Michael Dundek & Ruben Vasconcelos\, Electronic Arts
DESCRIPTION:In the dynamic landscape of application development and efficiently managing Kubernetes clusters while ensuring security\, isolation\, and ease of use is a persistent challenge. Electronic Arts developed a Kubernetes framework that transforms standard clusters into secure\, fully segregated multi-tenant platforms. Our custom operator and CRDs enable seamless tenant onboarding with complete isolation across network\, RBAC\, and resources. This approach allows teams to manage fewer clusters while reducing overall costs. Our solution simplifies complex deployments by handling ingress\, certificates\, secrets\, GitOps\, and daily operations through specialized CRDs. Development teams can leverage Kubernetes capabilities without managing its underlying complexity. This presentation reveals our problem-solving strategies and technical implementation details - essential knowledge for anyone tackling Kubernetes multi-tenancy challenges or seeking to simplify Kubernetes adoption for end users.

SUMMARY:Evolving Kubernetes Scheduling - Eric Tune & Wojciech Tyczyński\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Today\, Kubernetes users rely on extensions to provide key scheduling functionality needed by AI workloads\, including workload-aware scheduling and preemption\, and topology-aware scheduling. These extensions can keep clusters full of expensive accelerators highly utilized\, share them fairly between teams\, and support parallel training and inference on complex hardware topologies. However\, they are complex to write and maintain\, and are not designed to interoperate. In this session we offer a comparison of "second-level schedulers"\, including Kueue\, Volcano\, Ray\, and Slurm\, and of how they interact with the Kubernetes core scheduler (kube-scheduler). We'll cover the current and future work to extend kube-scheduler with resource reservations\, workload-awareness\, and integration with infrastructure autoscaling. These changes create a clear separation of responsibilities between the core and second-level schedulers.

SUMMARY:Llm-d: Multi-Accelerator LLM Inference on Kubernetes - Erwan Gallen\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Large language model serving has grown beyond one GPU per pod. Kubernetes clusters now mix GPUs\, TPUs and custom AI ASICs\, yet the community still needs a unified recipe to harness them. llm-d is a Kubernetes-native distributed-inference stack built around vLLM. It adds a workload-aware scheduler\, disaggregated prefill and decode\, a tiered KV cache and visibility into interconnect bandwidth\, from NIXL fabrics to GPU peer-to-peer links. This talk shows how llm-d feeds that topology data to Kubernetes so each request lands on the accelerator and network path that meets its latency target at the lowest cost. Attendees learn how llm-d reasons about accelerator classes and interconnects\, and receive a clear scorecard for selecting the best hardware mix for chat\, long-context or batch generation. They leave with a practical blueprint for llm-d understanding\, ready to combine high performance with tight budgets.

SUMMARY:Design Patterns for Consistent Centralized Authorization - José Padilla\, Auth0 & Alice Gibbons\, Diagrid
DESCRIPTION:Modern centralized authorization systems like OpenFGA don’t just centralize policy—they also amalgamate authorization data such as users\, roles\, and relationships. This shift brings great flexibility and visibility\, but introduces a key challenge: keeping that data in sync with distributed application state. As having a single shared database is an anti-pattern\, this talk will explore options to handle this challenge reliably at scale. Using Dapr’s building block APIs—including pub/sub and state management—attendees will learn how to coordinate consistent dual writes between apps and OpenFGA. Attendees will walk away with an architecture that emits domain events from services and uses Dapr to process them asynchronously\, ensuring consistency without tight coupling or fragile orchestration. José and Alice will demonstrate a real-world example where centralized authorization is integrated cleanly into an open source\, microservices system.

SUMMARY:Optimized Scheduling for Big Data Workloads - The Why\, What and How of K8s Schedulers - Rahul Sharma & Wilfred Spiegelenburg\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Stateful workloads like databases\, caching systems\, and message brokers are the backbone of many modern applications\, yet they pose distinct challenges within Kubernetes. Unlike their stateless counterparts\, these workloads demand persistent storage\, stable network identities\, and precise resource allocations. The default Kubernetes scheduler\, while robust\, often struggles to meet these specialized needs\, potentially resulting in performance degradation\, resource inefficiencies\, or operational instability. In this session\, we’ll take a deep dive into the art of scheduling stateful workloads\, breaking it down into three essential components - why\, what and how of the most popular Kubernetes schedulers out there. By the end of this talk\, attendees will walk away with a clear understanding of how to adapt Kubernetes scheduling to the unique demands of big data workloads.

SUMMARY:Supercharge Your Canary Deployments With Argo Rollouts Step Plugins - Kostis Kapelonis\, Octopus Deploy & Alexandre Gaudreault\, Intuit
DESCRIPTION:Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller for Progressive Delivery (blue/green and canary deployments). The controller already supports a plugin system for traffic providers (Istio\, Traefik\, Gateway API\, etc.) and for metric providers (Prometheus\, Datadog\, etc.). In the latest release\, the Argo team completed the trilogy by implementing support for Canary Step plugins. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. With Canary step plugins\, you can now fully control what happens DURING the canary process and implement any custom functionality that you want within the canary steps. Did you always want to do canary gating? Deployment sync between different controllers? Custom notifications while the canary is running? Now you can! In this talk we will see the architecture of the new plugin mechanism and explain how you can extend canary deployments with your own custom workflows.

SUMMARY:Help! My LLM Is a Resource Hog: How We Tamed Inference With Kubernetes and Open Source Muscle - Aditya Soni\, Forrester Research & Hrittik Roy\, Loft Labs
DESCRIPTION:A client came to us with a problem we’re seeing more and more\, their large language model (LLM) was deployed\, but inference was painfully slow\, GPU usage was unpredictable\, and costs were spiraling out of control. Kubernetes alone wasn’t enough\, they needed a production-ready\, efficient\, and scalable stack. In this talk\, we’ll walk through how we diagnosed and solved the issue using open-source CNCF tools\, turning a chaotic deployment into a well-oiled inference machine. You’ll learn how to: 1. Use KServe and Kubeflow to serve LLMs reliably. 2. Benchmark and auto-scale workloads using Volcano and KEDA while optimizing resource usage and latency. 3. Track model performance and drift with Prometheus\, Grafana\, and OpenTelemetry. We’ll share benchmarks\, architectures\, and lessons from the field\, all based on open-source tooling you can try today. Whether you’re running LLMs at scale or just exploring GenAI\, this talk is packed with real-world solutions to help you do more with less.

SUMMARY:Securing Data Applications at Pinterest With Finer Grained Access Control on Kubernetes - Soam Acharya & William Tom\, Pinterest
DESCRIPTION:At Pinterest\, our data processing platform runs nearly 90K jobs on 20K nodes ingesting about 200PB of data daily\, powering ML models\, user insights\, data lakes\, and more. This massive scale\, while pushing the limits of cloud computing\, requires secure\, least-privileged data management that also has to meet evolving regulations. To address these needs\, we introduced Finer Grained Access Control (FGAC) into Moka\, our new Kubernetes-based processing platform. FGAC integrates Kubernetes and AWS features (namespaces\, sidecars\, service accounts\, RBAC\, STS\, EKS\, IRSA) to authenticate with internal services (servicemesh\, mTLS\, IAM proxy) for a secure multi-tenant environment supporting Spark\, Ray\, and Flink. In this talk\, we detail our design for Moka FGAC and current migration status. We also share the trade-offs and design decisions that led to better data isolation\, scale\, improved resource utilization and an overall simpler approach compared to our previous Hadoop/Kerberos based solution.

SUMMARY:You Deployed What?! Data-Driven Lessons on Unsafe Helm Chart Defaults - Michael Katchinskiy & Yossi Weizman\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Most breach post-mortems start with “Which CVE?” However\, ours usually end with “There wasn’t one.” We analyzed 10 B Kubernetes audit events and scanned over 3000 clusters to map compromise paths that rely solely on insecure defaults shipped by default in widely trusted Helm charts. The pattern is painfully consistent: world-reachable Service/Ingress\, authentication set to “off by default\,” and a pod that have permissions to go wild. We’ll chain those three defaults against Apache Pinot\, Selenium Grid and Meshery all without a single vulnerability. To flip the script\, we’ll walk through hardening the same workloads using existing community tools like OPA Gatekeeper\, Kyverno\, Pod Security Admission\, and GitHub Actions to enforce guardrails before someone in your organization is going to deploy an "official" Helm chart.

SUMMARY:An Open Source AI Compute Stack: Kubernetes + Ray + PyTorch + VLLM - Robert Nishihara\, Anyscale
DESCRIPTION:AI workloads require increasing scale for both compute and data\, as well as significant heterogeneity across workloads\, models\, data types\, and hardware accelerators. As a consequence\, the software stack for running compute-intensive AI workloads is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Companies that productionize AI end up building large AI platform teams to manage these workloads. However\, within the fragmented landscape\, common patterns are beginning to emerge. This talk describes a popular software stack combining Kubernetes\, Ray\, PyTorch\, and vLLM. It describes the role of each of these frameworks\, how they operate together\, and illustrates this combination with case studies from Pinterest\, Uber\, and Roblox as well as from today’s most popular post-training frameworks.

SUMMARY:GitOps for AI Agents: Building Reliable AI Pipelines With Argo - Benji Kalman\, Root.io & Shiran Melamed\, JFrog
DESCRIPTION:As AI agents evolve from toy experiments to production-grade workflows\, engineering teams face new orchestration challenges. LLM-based agents don't just need GPUs—they need state\, retries\, memory & coordination across tools\, APIs\, & data systems. Enter Argo: the battle-tested workflow engine that's quietly becoming the backbone of serious agentic infrastructure. In this talk\, we'll explore how Argo Workflows power the runtime execution of complex agent pipelines—chaining tasks\, managing dependencies & scaling based on dynamic resource needs—while Argo CD provides GitOps-style control over the K8s infra and configurations those agents rely on. Together\, they enable full lifecycle management: declarative deployment\, dynamic execution\, and safe rollbacks. We'll also share how layering agents on top of Argo unlocks new capabilities—from safely iterating on prompt-driven pipelines\, to automatically rolling back failed steps\, to integrating observability and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

SUMMARY:Feature Flag Driven Development: Seamlessly Integrate Feature Flags Into Your SDLC - Kris Coleman\, TestifySec & Michael Beemer\, Dynatrace
DESCRIPTION:Feature flags decouple deployment from release\, enabling safe rollouts and continuous delivery. But at scale\, they introduce challenges: drift between environments\, inconsistent definitions\, and runtime bugs from undefined or mistyped flags. At one of the largest health systems in the US\, daily releases using feature flags boosted delivery speed but exposed risks due to poor flag hygiene. To address this\, we created Feature Flag Driven Development (FFDD)\; a workflow that embeds flag management into the SDLC. This talk introduces FFDD\, a practice that treats feature flags as first-class citizens. Built on the CNCF OpenFeature spec and tools like the OpenFeature CLI\, FFDD eliminates manual coordination\, reduces errors\, and enables GitOps-driven promotion. We’ll demo the full FFDD flow: defining flags\, generating type-safe code\, validating in CI\, syncing flags\, and promoting safely across environments using GitHub Actions.

SUMMARY:Quorum-Based Consistency for Cluster Changes With CloudNativePG Operator - Jeremy Schneider\, GEICO Tech & Leonardo Cecchi\, EDB
DESCRIPTION:Most people don’t think of Postgres in the context of quorum or distributed systems theory but vanilla open source Postgres has supported quorum commits across multiple replicas for almost 10 years now. Technologies like cassandra and dynamo popularized quorum consistency in the hot path of distributed writes and reads\, but the theory also applies to cluster reconfigurations in a single-writer database like Postgres. Stateful operators at level V of the capabilities framework require very careful end-to-end coordination between control plane and data plane algorithms to avoid data loss when providing auto-healing under circumstances like network partitions or compounded failures. This session will explore how quorum consistency can be applied in the CloudNativePG operator\, offering lessons and insights to fellow maintainers of other Kubernetes operators for stateful workloads.

SUMMARY:SIG Cloud Provider Deep Dive: Expanding Our Mission - Bridget Kromhout\, Microsoft; Michael McCune & Joel Speed\, Red Hat; Walter Fender\, Google; Jesse Butler\, AWS
DESCRIPTION:When SIG Cloud Provider began\, a major focus was the migration of cloud provider code out of the main Kubernetes code repository. The successful out-of-tree migration increased flexibility but also added challenges for testing and verification. We’ll cover where efficiencies and coordination between providers are making the ecosystem more robust. CSI\, CNI\, and other domain-specific API solutions often lack broader reuse across the ecosystem\, so providers themselves are collaborating to build the authoritative low-level KRM layer\, clearing the way with robust cloud resource management abstractions so as to allow builders to create solutions at higher layers.\n\nThe SIG maintainers will discuss how doing more collaboration and creating cross-provider building blocks in the Kubernetes community will lead to a better platform for everyone. Expect to walk away from this talk with a clear vision for where SIG Cloud Provider has evolved\, and how you can contribute to creating the SIG’s future!

SUMMARY:Deep Dive: Handling Kubernetes Memory Pressure & Achieving Workload Stability With NodeSwap - Ajay Sundar Karuppasamy\, Google LLC & Itamar Holder\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Effectively managing memory pressure is key to stable Kubernetes workloads and preventing OOM errors. This talk shows how using disk-space as temporary memory (swap) on Kubernetes nodes enhances application stability and makes your nodes more resilient to memory spikes. The Kubernetes ‘NodeSwap’ feature\, set for GA in 1.34\, promises better resource management and node stability. NodeSwap offers stability for long-running applications from abrupt termination due to sudden memory spikes. However\, swap is not without trade-offs\, as it can decrease predictability and degrade performance for some workloads. We'll share our stress-test learnings on potential problems and performance tuning with kernel parameters to optimize swap on Kubernetes nodes. Attendees will learn practical swap utilization limits\, recommended configurations and their effects on node stability. We will also discuss ongoing work of a critical pod-level API for fine-grained swap control and workload compatibility.

SUMMARY:From Code To Cluster: Orchestrating 100\,000+ Kubernetes Deployments With 1 Pipeline - Andrada Raducanu\, ING Hubs Romania
DESCRIPTION:There is a sea of tools one can use for the critical phase of Deployment during your SDLC. To keep our environment secure and reliable\, ING chose to work with Kubernetes and Azure DevOps. In this talk\, we will share the success story of how 1400 in-house developed APIs reached 100k+ Production deployments in half a year\, using one single pipeline. In order to stay in control\, we use Open Policy Agent. To ensure the reliability and the resilience of the APIs\, we use tools like: QuotaAutoscaler (ING open source CRD) and HorizontalPodAustoscaler\, native rollback mechanisms with Helm\, automatic certificates using CertManager and Prometheus monitoring. The pipeline deploys code in Azure Kubernetes Service and on-prem Kubernetes clusters. This solution was built as a platform\, designed to be agnostic to the target system\, reducing the cognitive load on the teams and allowing them to focus on the application development. We call this The Kingsroad.

SUMMARY:Turbocharging Argo CD: Replacing Redis With Dragonfly for Better Performance and Lower Bills - Soumya Ghosh Dastidar & Justin Marquis\, Akuity Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Argo CD is a foundational tool in GitOps workflows\, enabling declarative continuous delivery in Kubernetes environments. However\, it relies heavily on Redis for caching and state management\, making Redis a critical component that can become a bottleneck as workloads scale. Enter Dragonfly\, a drop-in Redis replacement purpose-built for modern cloud hardware. Dragonfly delivers up to 25x better performance at 80% lower cost\, making it a compelling alternative for performance-intensive Kubernetes-native applications. In this session\, we’ll share how we seamlessly replaced Redis in Argo CD with Dragonfly\, using the Dragonfly Operator without modifying Argo CD’s internals. You’ll learn how to deploy Dragonfly with Kubernetes-native tooling\, manage it at scale\, and configure it for high availability\, security\, and resilience. This talk is ideal for platform engineers\, SREs\, DevOps teams\, and Kubernetes users seeking improved performance\, lower costs\, or easier Redis operations.
